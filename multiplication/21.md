F11 (89): The decimal expansion of 89's reciprocal (1/89) is period-44 (see graphic below) composed of 22 bi-lateral 9 sums = 198, while 89 + 109 = 198, 7920/198 = 40 and 8,363,520/198 = 20 x 2112 (7919's index number as a member of this domain). And, curiously, 198's inverse (891) + 109 = 1000, while the sum of 89 and 109's inverses, 98 + 901, = 999. Then consider that, while it's obvious 997 of the first 1000 primes are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, one might miss the fact that 997 minus its reverasl, 799, = 198 = 89 + 109. And for the record we note that 1/109's decimal expansion is period 108 (making it a 'long period prime' in that 1/p has the maximal period of p−1 digits). This period consists of 54 bilateral 9 sums = 486, which (coincidentally?) is the number of primes in the 243 pairs summing to 7920 (more about these, below). _([PrimesDemystified](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html))_

```note
1092 − 892 = 3960 and 3960 x 2 = 7920; which equates to 8,363,520/(1092 − 892) = 2112, and when you plug 7919 into the formula for triangular numbers you generate 31,359,240 = 7919 x (1092 − 892). And here's another grouping that relates to these ratios: (672 − 232) = (1092 − 892) and (672 + 1092) − (232 + 892) = 7920 = 2(1092 − 892). And here we correlate 11's additive sums with 3960, 7920 and the first 1000 prime numbers. _([PrimesDemystified](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html))_

```note
The symmetry of this supergravity theory is given by the supergroup OSp(1❕32) which gives the subgroups O(1) for the bosonic symmetry and Sp(32) for the fermion symmetry. ***This is because spinors need 32 components in 11 dimensions***. 11D supergravity can be compactified down to 4 dimensions which then has OSp(8❕4) symmetry. (We still have 8 × 4 = 32 so there are still the same number of components.) Spinors need 4 components in 4 dimensions. This gives O(8) for the gauge group which is too small to contain the Standard Model gauge group U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) ***which would need at least O(10)***.

## Shock wave

Many physicists suspect that the fact that the observable universe contains [more matter than antimatter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry) is caused by a [chiral anomaly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_anomaly#cite_note-1)

```note
The pion is one of the particles that mediate the residual strong interaction between a pair of [nucleons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleons). This interaction is attractive: it pulls the nucleons together. Written in a non-relativistic form, it is called the [Yukawa potential](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_potential).
- The pion, being spinless, has [kinematics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics) described by the [Klein–Gordon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein%E2%80%93Gordon_equation).
- In the terms of [quantum field theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), the [effective field theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory) [Lagrangian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory)) describing the pion-nucleon interaction is called the ***[Yukawa interaction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_interaction)***.
- The nearly identical masses of π± and π° indicate that there must be a symmetry at play: this symmetry is called the [SU(2)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(2)) [flavour symmetry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavour_symmetry) or [isospin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isospin). The reason that there are ***three (3) pions, π+, π− and π°***, is that these are understood to belong to the triplet representation or the [adjoint representation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_representation_of_a_Lie_group) ***3 of SU(2)***.
- By contrast, the up and down quarks transform according to the [fundamental representation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_representation) ***2 of SU(2)***, whereas the anti-quarks transform according to the conjugate representation 2*.
- With the addition of the [strange quark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_quark), the pions participate in a larger, SU(3), flavour symmetry, in the adjoint representation, ***eight (8) of SU(3)***.
- The other members of this [octet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_way_(physics)#Meson_octet) are the four (4) [kaons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaon) and the [eta meson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_meson).

Pions are [pseudoscalars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscalar_(physics)) under a [parity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)) transformation. Pion currents thus couple to the axial vector current and so participate in the [chiral anomaly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_anomaly). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion))_

In phenomenology, Yukawa coupling can be observed in phenomenology from 6 quark masses and 4 CKM mixing parameters.

```note
Since the range of the nuclear force was known, ***Yukawa used his equation to predict the mass of the mediating particle as [about two hundreds (200) times](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13961751/Yukawa.pdf) the mass of the electron***. Physicists called this particle the "[meson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson)," as its mass was in the middle of the proton and electron. Yukawa's meson was found in 1947, and came to be known as the [pion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_potential#History))_

```note
Depending on the conditions surrounding the lightning rod such as the air composition, atmospheric pressure, ***the thunder will travel at a unique velocity, pitch, frequency band and duration depending on the characteristics of the lightning rod***.

This is typical for processes in which the so-called initial state radiation takes place.
