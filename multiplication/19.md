In particle physics, an _[elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle)_ or fundamental particle is a subatomic particle that is not composed of other particles. 

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

Subatomic particles such as protons or neutrons, which contain two or more elementary particles, are known as composite particles.

The numbers  all spiral around O, this spiral makes the  124875 doubling circuit and also correlates 369. 124875 is also  a halving circuit.

For some Enneagram theorists the lines connecting the points add further meaning to the information provided by the descriptions of the types. Some times called the "security" and "stress" points, or points of "integration" and "disintegration".

```note
In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), an enneagram (üüô U+1F7D9) is a nine-pointed plane figure. It is sometimes called a nonagram, nonangle, or enneagon.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-1)

The word 'enneagram' combines the [numeral prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix) [ennea-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ennea-) with the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) suffix [-gram](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-gram). The gram suffix derives from Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒº·øÜ (grammƒì) meaning a line.
- A regular enneagram is a 9-sided [star polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polygon). It is constructed using the same points as the regular [enneagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagon), but the points are connected in fixed steps.
- Two forms of regular enneagram exist:
  - One form connects every second point and is represented by the [Schl√§fli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol) {9/2}.
  - The other form connects every fourth point and is represented by the Schl√§fli symbol {9/4}.
- There is also a star figure, {9/3} or 3{3}, made from the regular enneagon points but connected as a compound of three equilateral triangles.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-4) (If the triangles are alternately interlaced, this results in a [Brunnian link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunnian_link).)
- From this perspective, there are twenty-seven (27) distinct [personality patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Instinctual_subtypes), because people of each of the nine (9) types also express themselves as one of the three (3) subtypes.

This star figure is sometimes known as the star of [Goliath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath), after [{6/2} or 2{3}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram), the star of [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-5)  _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)))_

Vortex Based Mathematics transcends our myopic quantitative understanding for the way Number operates in our holographic universe.  Numbers are not just mere quantities.   Each has its own unique quality, archetype, and behavior.  Vortex Based Math (VBM) is the study of Number in and of itself.  Numeronomy as opposed to Numerology.  The bedrock of the [Quadrivium](http://joedubs.com/the-seven-liberal-arts/), Number structures our conceptual waking reality.  As Pythagoras once so aptly put it, ‚ÄúAll is Number‚Äù. _([JoeDubs](https://joedubs.com/vortex-based-mathematics-numerically-conceptualizing-reality/))_

Explanatory diagram showing how symmetry breaking works. At a high enough energy level, a ball settled in the center (lowest point), and the result has [symmetry](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Symmetry). At lower energy levels, the center becomes unstable, the ball rolls to a lower point - but in doing so, it settles on an (arbitrary) position and the result is that symmetry is broken - the resulting position is not symmetrical _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking))_

Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Ames Laboratory have discovered a new type of Weyl semimetal, a material that opens the way for further study of Weyl fermions, a type of massless elementary particle hypothesized by high-energy particle theory and potentially useful for creating high-speed electronic circuits and quantum computers.
- Researchers created a crystal of molybdenum and tellurium, one of only a few compounds that had been predicted to host a new and recently postulated type of Weyl state, where the hole and electron bands normally separated by an indirect gap touch at a few Weyl points. Those points are equivalent to magnetic monopoles in the momentum space and are connected by Fermi arcs.
- A combination of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), modelling, density functional theory and careful calculations were used to confirm the existence of this new type of Weyl semimetal. This material provides an exciting new platform to study the properties of Weyl fermions, and may lead the way to more new materials with unusual transport properties.

‚ÄúThis an important, interdisciplinary discovery because it allows us to study many aspects of these exotic particles predicted by high energy physics theory in solid state, without need for extremely expensive particle accelerators,‚Äù said Adam Kaminsky, Ames Laboratory scientist and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University. ‚ÄúFrom my perspective as solid state physicist it is absolutely extraordinary to observe two bands touching each other at certain points and being connected by Fermi arcs ‚Äì objects that are prohibited to exist in ‚Äúordinary‚Äù materials.‚Äù _([rdworldonline.com](https://www.rdworldonline.com/new-material-discovery-allows-study-of-elusive-weyl-fermion/))_

This proposition was first demonstrated by Edwin Hubble (1889-1953). The American astronomer discovered in 1929 that every galaxy is pulling away from us, and that the most distant galaxies are moving the most quickly. This suggests that there was a time in the past when all the galaxies were located at the same spot, a time that can only correspond to the Big Bang. _([Hubble bubble](https://www.indiatvnews.com/science/hubble-bubble-hypothesis-reveals-mystry-of-universe-expansion-597015))_
