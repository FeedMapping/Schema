## Rational Objects

In number theory, ***[the partition functionp(n) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory))*** represents the number of possible partitions of a non-negative integer n. Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (_[Diophantine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_geometry)_).

```note
The central problem is to determine when a Diophantine equation has solutions, and if it does, how many. Two examples of an elliptic curve, that is, a curve of genus 1 having at least ***one rational point***. Either graph can be seen as a slice of a torus in four-dimensional space _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory#Diophantine_geometry))_.
```

One of the main reason is that one does not yet have a mathematically complete example of a quantum gauge theory in four-dimensional space-time. It is even a sign that Einstein’s equations on the energy of empty space are somehow incomplete.

```note
Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Scientific_career))_.

Speculation is that the unfinished book of Ramanujan's partition, series of Dyson's solutions and hugh of Einstein's papers tend to solve it.

Dyson introduced the concept in the context of a study of _[certain congruence properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%27s_congruences)_ of the partition function discovered by the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan who the one that found the interesting behaviour of the [taxicab number 1729](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#prime-identity).

```note
The concept was introduced by [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson)in a paper published in the journal [Eureka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(University_of_Cambridge_magazine)). It was [presented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition#cite_note-Dyson-1) in the context of a study of certain [congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation) properties of the [partition function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)) discovered by the Indian mathematical genius [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan). _([Wikipedia](https://e

[Young tableaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_tableau) were introduced by Alfred Young, a mathematician at Cambridge University, in 1900. They were then applied to the study of the symmetric group. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians, including [W. V. D. Hodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_theory)

## Supersymmetry

In mathematics, the rank of a partition is the number obtained by subtracting the number of parts in the partition from the largest part in the partition.
 
```note
On the other hand, one does not yet have a mathematically complete example of a quantum gauge theory in 4D Space vs Time, nor even a precise definition of quantum gauge theory in four dimensions. Will this change in the 21st century? We hope so! _([Clay Institute's - Official problem description](https://claymath.org/sites/default/files/yangmills.pdf))_.

This idea was taken as the earliest in 1960s [Swinnerton-Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC) by using the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to get the number of points modulo p (denoted by Np) for a large number of primes p on elliptic curves whose rank was known. 

```note
From these numerical results ***the conjecture predicts that the data should form a line of slope equal to the rank of the curve***, which is 1 in this case drawn in red in red on the graph _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture#Current_status))_.

Unfortunately the rotation of this eigenvalues deals with [four-dimensional space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space) which was already a big issue.

In 1904 the French mathematician Henri Poincaré asked if the three dimensional sphere is characterized as the unique simply connected three manifold. This question, the Poincaré conjecture, was a special case of Thurston's geometrization conjecture. 

```note
Perelman's proof tells us that every three manifold is built from a set of standard pieces, each with one of eight well-understood geometries _([ClayMath Institute](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/poincar%C3%A9-conjecture))_.

More generally, the central problem is to determine when an equation in n-dimensional space has solutions. However at this point, we finaly found that the prime distribution has something to do with _[the subclasses of rank and crank partitions](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#the-subclasses-of-each-partitions)_.

The Ricci flow is a pde for evolving the metric tensor in a Riemannian manifold ***to make it rounder***, in the hope that one may draw topological conclusions from the existence of such “round” metrics.

```note
Poincaré hypothesized that if such a space has the additional property that each loop in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture))_
```

The Ricci Flow method has now been _[developed](http://engine.scichina.com/publisher/scp/journal/SCIS/62/9/10.1007/s11432-018-9702-7)_ not only in to geometric but also to the conversion of facial shapes in three (3) dimensions to computer data. A big leap in the field of AI ([Artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)). No wonder now all the science leads to it.

So what we've discussed on this wiki is entirely nothing but an embodiment of this solved [Poincare Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture). This is the one placed with id: 10 (ten) which stands as the basic algorithm of _[π(10)=(2,3,5,7)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#lexer-vs-parser)_.

```note
Many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence. AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence _([Human vs AI](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.622364/full))_.

[![Poincaré Conjecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84187330-17515080-aabc-11ea-8e53-47f12a248d4c.jpg)](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/poincar%C3%A9-conjecture)

Finite collections of objects are considered 0-dimensional. Objects that are "dragged" versions of zero-dimensional objects are then called one-dimensional. Similarly, objects which are dragged one-dimensional objects are two-dimensional, and so on. 

```note
The basic ideas leading up to this result (including the dimension invariance theorem, domain invariance theorem, and Lebesgue covering dimension) were developed by **Poincaré**, Brouwer, Lebesgue, Urysohn, and Menger _([MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html))_.

## Spacetime Patterns

In vector calculus, the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function of several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. 

```note
It's possible to build a _[Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix)_ for a _[Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization)_ step using the Jacobian method. ***You would first flatten out its axes into a matrix, and flatten out the gradient into a vector.*** _([Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#batch_jacobian))_
```

[![Tensorflow - Batch Jacobian](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/128624639-b5d8c73f-79af-4433-8b7b-28a35e331d21.png)](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#batch_jacobian)

When the subclasses of partitions are flatten out into a matrix, you want to take the Jacobian of each of a stack of targets with respect to a stack of sources, where the Jacobians for each target-source pair are independent.

```note
***When this matrix is square, that is, when the function takes the same number of variables as input as the number of vector components of its output, its determinant is referred to as the Jacobian determinant***. Both the matrix and (if applicable) the determinant ad  often referred to simply as the Jacobian in literature. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant))_
```

## Double Strands

Here we adopt an analysis of variance called _N/P-Integration_ that was applied to find the best set of environmental variables that describe the density out of distance matrices.

```note
With collaborators, we regularly work on projects where we want to understand the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial community in the context of metadata often recorded under specific hypotheses. Integrating (***N-/P- integration***; see figure below) these datasets require a fair deal of multivariate statistical analysis for which I have shared the [code](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html) on this website. _([Umer.Ijaz](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/#intro))_
```

[![N-/P- integration](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/661ff31c-1224-40e6-b4d8-968c0bb1d396)](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/#intro)

It can be used to build parsers/compilers/interpreters for various use cases ranging from simple config files to full fledged programming languages.

```note
With theoretical foundations in [Information Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_engineering) (Discrete Mathematics, Control Theory, System Theory, Information Theory, and Statistics), my research has delivered a suite of systems and products that has allowed me to carve out a niche within an extensive collaborative network (>200 academics). _([Umer.Ijaz](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/#intro))_
```

Since such interactions result in a change in momentum, they can give rise to classical _[Newtonian forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics)_ of rotation and revolution by means of [orbital structure](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#orbital-structure).

![torus](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/2a9a7df2-b82f-48da-a190-2292d16d4ac2)

As you can see on the left sidebar (dekstop mode) a total of 102 items will be reached by the end of `Id: 35`. 

[![](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/129c18a9-6476-4853-b337-5ed446bc7937)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)

So when they transfered to `Id: 36` it will cover [`11 x 6 = 66 items`](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/) thus the total will be `102 + 66 = 168`
