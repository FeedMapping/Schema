        <p>Introduced earlier in GUTS: The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and, thus, must contain quantum gravity.</p><ul>  <li>The main tenet of Superstring theory is that fundamental particles, including the graviton that carries the gravitational force, act like one-dimensional vibrating strings.</li>  <li>Since gravity affects the time and space in which all else exists, Superstring theory is an attempt at a Theory of Everything (TOE).</li>  <li>Each independent quantum number is thought of as a separate dimension in some super space (analogous to the fact that the familiar dimensions of space are independent of one another) and is represented by a different type of Superstring.</li>  <li>As the universe evolved after the Big Bang and forces became distinct (spontaneous symmetry breaking), some of the dimensions of superspace are imagined to have curled up and become unnoticed.</li>  <li>Forces are expected to be unified only at extremely high energies and at particle separations on the order of 10^-35m. This could mean that Superstrings must have dimensions or wavelengths of this size or smaller.</li>  <li>Just as quantum gravity may imply that there are no time intervals shorter than some finite value, it also implies that there may be no sizes smaller than some tiny but finite value. That may be about 10^-35m.</li>  <li>If so, and if Superstring theory can explain all it strives to, then the structures of Superstrings are at the lower limit of the smallest possible size and can have no further substructure.</li>  <li>This would be the ultimate answer to the question the ancient Greeks considered: There is a finite lower limit to space. Not only is Superstring theory in its infancy, it deals with dimensions about 17 orders of 10^-18m magnitude smaller than the details that we have been able to observe directly.</li>  <li>It is thus relatively unconstrained by experiment, and there are a host of theoretical possibilities to choose from. This has led theorists to make choices subjectively (as always) on what is the most elegant theory, with less hope than usual that experiment will guide them.</li>  <li>It has also led to <strong><em>speculation of alternate universes</em></strong>, with their Big Bangs creating each new universe with a random set of rules. These speculations may not be tested even in principle, since an alternate universe is by definition unattainable. It is something like exploring a self-consistent field of mathematics, with its axioms and rules of logic that are not consistent with nature.</li></ul><p>Such endeavors have often given insight to mathematicians and scientists alike and occasionally have been directly related to the description of new discoveries. <em>(<a href="https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/College_Physics_2e-WEB_7Zesafu.pdf">College Physics 2e - pdf page 1518</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>Think of it this way, all gravitating bodies in the universe would be surrounded at all times by a cloud of tunneling electrons. We cannot see these particles since they’re so small and since they permeate all of space. They would also tunnel to a different location about once every Planck time (about 10^-43 seconds) whenever they interact with another particle.</p><ul>  <li>These interactions between particles amount to the exchanges of bosons between electrons and other electrons or other fermions. At each point where the electron absorbs another boson, we say that the wave function of the electron collapses, and it tunnels to a new location whereupon it interacts with yet another particle.</li>  <li>The cloud of electron surrounding gravitating objects would diminish in inverse proportion to the square of the distance; hence, if you recede from an objects’ surface, you’re less likely to find an electron tunneling from that object.</li>  <li>Electrons also make an excellent candidate for a particle of gravity since they absorb and emit photons readily, and we know from Einstein’s theory of general relativity that light interacts readily with gravitational fields, and that gravitational fields are thought to emit photons spontaneously.</li>  <li>This spontaneous emission of photons is what we refer to as the cosmological constant or dark energy, and in our current thinking on the topic we imagine that particles of antimatter are created and annihilate with particles of matter leading, occasionally, to the emission of a photon. I suspect that this is incorrect and that no such thing as antimatter really exists. I suspect that positrons are really tunneling W particles and that this Dirac Sea, or background of tunneling electrons, is really giving rise to this phenomenon of the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, we observe inn nature.</li>  <li>As a consequence, we would need to adumbrate our standard model of particle physics by about half. This ought to be seen as a positive thing in physics. No longer do we have untestable assumptions (such as the creation and annihilation of particles) in our models, and we have a far easier means of now beginning to probe the quantum nature of gravity.</li></ul><p>The other fascinating consequence of this way of thinking is that gravity would no longer be a fundamental force; instead it would be a secondary effect of electromagnetism. This should have been what we anticipated all along; and now, we might have a quantum theory focusing on only three forces and a theory of gravitation that is truly particle-based. <em>(<a href="https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968">Medium - Article</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>Folio math is similar to modular math, but instead of the numbers wrapping around or spinning around a unit circle, they turn back at different positions on both the X and Y axis. <strong><em>In other words, they never make full cycles</em></strong>.</p><ul>  <li>The Y-Axis splits at the top, and the X-Axis splits on the left. The colors help this stand out. Let’s start with the top of the Y-Axis. <strong><em>All digits at the top of the Y-Axis reduce down to 1,7,4 or 5,2,8</em></strong>.</li>  <li>This is important. Using this Prime Number Folio Coordinate System, it’s easier to think of prime numbers in separate sequences across from each other and right or left-handed rather than next to each other on a number line. I see them as Chiral.</li>  <li>All digits in on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis reduce down to 5, 2 or 8. (For example 179 has 3 digits, what matters is that the numbers 1 +7+9 sum to the number 8.) So this would be considered a right-handed prime number. Or a number on the right side of the Y-Axis.</li></ul><p>The image stands on its own. The patterns should jump off the page. Especially with the color. Right-handed numbers have different properties than the left-handed numbers. These observations are in no way mathematically rigorous.</p><ul>  <li>The numbers on the right side <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(5,2,8)|</code> of the Y-Axis include not only prime numbers, but the products of the prime numbers combined from both sides of the Y-axis.</li>  <li>Every product on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis is created from two primes (or semi-primes or combination of semi-primes) from both sides of the Y-axis (one from each side), which ALWAYS sum to an exact multiple of 6. These are plotted on the right side of the X-Axis. (For example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7×11=77</code>. While <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7+11=18</code>.)</li></ul><p>Using this Folio Coordinate System, it’s easy to see how the products and sums and their distribution are directly related to each other. You might want to start thinking about the Goldbach Conjecture.</p><ul>  <li>All products and sums on the right side are indigo/purple to show how they combine with the red and blue prime numbers.</li>  <li>It looks like we are simply adding 6 to each Axis/number line, when in fact we are adding the number 1 to each consecutive number but positioning it at different points while moving around both the X and Y Axis.</li>  <li>The colors should help your eye follow the numbers. Follow the colors of the rainbow/number combination to help you move around the system. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(R-1,O-2,Y-3,G-4,B-5,I-6)</code>.</li></ul><p><strong><em>The number 35 is an important number</em></strong>. It’s the first number on the right-hand side that’s a product of two prime factors of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5 x 7 = 35</code>.</p><ul>  <li>The sum of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5 + 7 = 12</code>. Since the right-handed numbers are distributed evenly by 6, we can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7 x 6 = 42</code> to 35 and land on the number 77.</li>  <li>So now we know that starting with the number 35 if we add 42 continuously we will <strong><em>NEVER land on a prime number</em></strong>. We can also add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5 x 6 = 42</code> to 35 and land on 65.</li>  <li>We also know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7 + 11 = 18</code>. The next number that introduces a product of two primes is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5 x 13 = 65</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5 + 13 = 18</code>. So we can take <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6 x 13 = 78</code> and add this to 65 and land on 143. Which is the product of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">11 x 13 = 143</code>.</li>  <li>Starting with 65 we can add 78 continuously and <strong><em>NEVER land on a prime number</em></strong>.</li>  <li>In the meantime 77 (The product of 7 and 11 now introduces the prime number 11 into the mix. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">77 + (6x11) = 143</code>.</li>  <li><strong><em>Starting with 77 we can add 66 continuously and NEVER land on a prime number</em></strong>.</li></ul><p>You can’t add multiples of 6 until that multiple is introduced into the sequence. The primes on the left behave differently. You can still move around using multiples of 6, but there is no common starting point like the number 35.</p><ul>  <li>You have to start with the squares of <strong><em>5 at 25 (in blue)</em></strong> for one sequence of numbers and the square of <strong><em>7 at 49 (in red)</em></strong> for the other sequence of numbers.</li>  <li>The sums of these products are also not exact multiples of 6.
