Under certain conditions, energy could not take on any indiscriminate value, the energy must be some multiple of a very small quantity (later to be known as a ***quantum***).

This is also consistent with the fact that the quadratic residues for modulo 30 (making them congruent with perfect squares) are ***1 and 19***.

The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanis≈Çaw Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later.

```note
Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines ***is not unexpected***, as lines in the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's prime-generating polynomial x¬≤-x+41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with **major unsolved problems** in number theory such as Landau's problems _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral))_.

## Fibonacci Retracement

```note
The weak mixing angle or Weinberg angle[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinberg_angle#cite_note-3) is a parameter in the [Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg)‚Äì[Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam) theory of the [electroweak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction), part of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) of particle physics, and is usually denoted as Œ∏W. ***It is the angle by which [spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/10.html#spontaneous-symmetry-breaking) [rotates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) the original W0 and B0 [vector boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) plane, producing as a result the Z0 boson, and the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinberg_angle#cite_note-Cheng-Li-2006-4)***.

More interesting is that, like the [Prime Hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/) it self, they are newly discovered. See how these layers will _[behave](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#residual-objects)_ there:

This progression 41,43,47,53,61,71,83,97,113,131 whose general term is ***41+x+xx***, is as much remarkable since the ***40 first terms*** are all prime numbers _([Euler's letter to Bernoulli](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1722188/908994))_.

So here we are going to discuss about this number particularly with the said recombination which resulting the above **Œî1 with 619**.

There are many other [prime curiousity](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?short=619) has been stated for this number 619 but [almost none](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?short=618) about 619-1 which is 618.

There are set of sequence known as _[Fibonacci retracement](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/fibonacciretracement.asp#:~:text=The%20key%20Fibonacci%20ratio%20of,two%20spots%20to%20the%20right.)_. For unknown reasons, these Fibonacci ratios seem to play a role in the _[stock market](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#hexagonal-patterns)_, just as they do in nature. 

```note
The mathematically significant Fibonacci sequence defines a set of ratios known as _Fibonacci retracements_ which can be used to determine probable ***[entry and exit points](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)*** for the equities when paired with additional momentum. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 0.236, 0.382, ***0.618, and 0.786***.
- The key Fibonacci ratio of 61.8% is found by dividing one number in the series by the number that follows it. For example, 21 divided by 34 equals 0.6176, and 55 divided by 89 equals about 0.61798.
- The 38.2% ratio is discovered by dividing a number in the series by the number located two spots to the right. For instance, 55 divided by 144 equals approximately 0.38194.
- The 23.6% ratio is found by dividing one number in the series by the number that is three places to the right. For example, 8 divided by 34 equals about 0.23529.
- The 78.6% level is given by the _[square root](https://youtu.be/K-AvE0B1KMw)_ of 61.8%, while not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 0.5 is also commonly referenced (50% is derived not from the Fibonacci sequence but rather from the idea that on average stocks retrace half their earlier movements). _([Golden Ratio - Articles](https://www.fnb.co.za/blog/investments/articles/FibonacciandtheGoldenRatio/))_

They are used to determine critical points where an _[asset's momentum is likely to reverse](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-10)_. This study cascade culminating in the Fibonacci digital root sequence (also period-24). 

## Truncated Perturbation

```note
I wondered if that property might hold for the incremental powers of phi as well. For this reason I chose to see numbers in the hexagon as quantum, and truncate off the decimal values to determine which integer cell they land in.
```

```
That is what I found.  Phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated.
```

```liquid
Direction:
- The initial of 168 & 329 brings the 102 as 100+2 to œÄ(œÄ(10000))-1=200 or 100 x 2.
- Then the 289 lets this 100x2 to 100¬≤ so it brings 100 to 10000 by the power of 2.
- At the last it will be separated by the scheme of 168 to 102 goes back 100 and 2.
 
Conclusion:
- All of the other primes than 2 is 1 less than the number n times the number of 2. 
- Those Mersenne primes is generated as 1 less than the power n of the number of 2. 
- Thus they will conseqently be carried out by the same scheme of this number of 2.
```

```note
Speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, there is symmetry mirroring the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve.
