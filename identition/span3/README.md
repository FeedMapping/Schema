It turns out that quantum string theory always destroys the symmetries of classical string theory, **except in one special case: when the number of dimensions is 10**.

Below is a model of E11 (shown by 11 dimensions). Its absolute dimensions represent all related key knowledges of modern physics. Moreover this model represents [Quark-Gluon Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma), with all of the [fundamental forces](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#fundamental-forces) in the early stage after _[Big Bang](https://youtu.be/7VgoECW06-s?si=_l-Pu42gwtnxzzT2)_ which probably comes from [Absolute Nothingness](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-the-universe-the-cosmos-space-and-nothing/answer/George-Davros).

The Prime Spiral Sieve possesses remarkable structural and numeric symmetries. For starters, the intervals between the prime roots (and every subsequent row or rotation of the sieve) are perfectly balanced, with a period ***eight (8) difference sequence*** of: {6, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2} _([Primesdemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries))_.

```note
Quantum field theory is any theory that describes a quantized field.
- QED, or Quantum Electrodynamics, is the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, a so-called Abelian field (referencing an internal mathematical symmetry of the theory.)
- Electroweak theory is a generalization of QED, unifying it with the weak nuclear force in the form of a Yang-Mills field theory (aka. a non-Abelian field theory).
- QCD, or Quantum Chromodynamics, is another example of a non-Abelian field theory, but one with very different asymptotic behavior than electroweak theory.
- The Standard Model of particle physics is the combination of electroweak theory and QCD in the form of a unified theory obeying a complex set of symmetries.

This theory describes all the known fields and all the known interactions other than gravity. _([Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-the-difference-between-QED-QCD-Electroweak-theory-Standard-model-Quantum-field-theory-and-how-are-they-related-together))_

Speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, there is symmetry mirroring the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve.

These objects will then behave as a complex numbers that leads to trivial and complex roots of the _[18th prime identity](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#residual-objects)_.

We show that the Big Bang singularity of the Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker model does not raise major problems to General Relativity.
- We prove a theorem showing that the Einstein equation can be written in a non-singular form, which allows the extension of the spacetime before the Big Bang.
- The old method of resolution of singularities shows how we can “untie” the singularity of a cone and obtain a cylinder.
- This illustrates the idea that it is not necessary to assume that, at the Big Bang singularity, the entire space was a point, but only that the space metric was 0.

These results follow from our research on singular semi-Riemannian geometry and singular General Relativity [26, 27, 29] (which we applied in previous articles to the black hole singularities [30, 31, 32, 28]).

The opposite direction will be made through switching beetween Linux and Windows which is proceed the old strand in the 3′ to 5′ direction, while the new strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. Here we set a remote self-host runner via WSL.

The rest of primes goes to the [33's of 15th axis](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-19_root-md) that holding 102 primes of (2,60,40). By the bilateral way the form will be [splitted](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-parser-md) to (1,30,20). Since the base frame shall be 40 so it will be forced to form ***(1,30,40) of prime 71***.
