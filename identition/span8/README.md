In many ways, a _[black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole)_ acts like an ideal black body, as ***it reflects no light***. Here is an animated simulation of a Schwarzschild black hole with a galaxy passing behind. Around the time of alignment, extreme gravitational lensing of the galaxy is observed.

According to the observations made by NASA, Astronomers have uncovered ***[TON 618](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TON_618#Supermassive_black_hole)*** as the record breaking supermassive black hole, weighing 66 trillion and brilliantly as 140 trillion times that of the Sun, making it one of the brightest object in the Universe. 

[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/223629156-8cfdfb46-1884-4f45-bbb6-d11093ac3834.png)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#rotation-vs-revolution)

If the statement that it is indeed located at the center of our universe then the said black hole would behave as the exchange position between ***[twin (2) universes](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#dark-energi)***. This would for sure strengthen the syntax algorithm of our _[implementation](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-implementation)_.

Direction:
- The initial of 168 & 329 brings the 102 as 100+2 to π(π(10000))-1=200 or 100 x 2.
- Then the 289 lets this 100x2 to 100² so it brings 100 to 10000 by the power of 2.
- At the last it will be separated by the scheme of 168 to 102 goes back 100 and 2.
 
Conclution:
- All of the other primes than 2 is 1 less than the number n times the number of 2. 
- Those Mersenne primes is generated as 1 less than the power n of the number of 2. 
- Thus they will conseqently be carried out by the same scheme of this number of 2.
```

Perceptually, everything is separate and finite. But actually, everything is connected and infinite. It is this infinite connection, despite our limited finite perceptions, that makes us one with the cosmos.

## Primes Platform

```note
This progression 41,43,47,53,61,71,83,97,113,131 whose general term is ***41+x+xx***, is as much remarkable since the ***40 first terms*** are all prime numbers _([Euler's letter to Bernoulli](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1722188/908994))_.
```

```liquid
1st layer:
It has a total of 1000 numbers
Total primes = π(1000) = 168 primes

2nd layer:
It will start by π(168)+1 as the 40th prime
It has 100x100 numbers or π(π(10000)) = 201 primes
Total cum primes = 168 + (201-40) = 168+161 = 329 primes

3rd layer:
Behave the same as 2nd layer which has a total of 329 primes
The primes will start by π(π(π(1000th prime)))+1 as the 40th prime
This 1000 primes will become 1000 numbers by 1st layer of the next level
Total of all primes = 329 + (329-40) = 329+289 = 618 = 619-1 = 619 primes - Δ1 
```

Plottng ***40th prime scheme*** of the three (3) layers with all the features of 3rd prime identity as explained above then they would form their recycing through the three (3) times bilateral 9 sums as shown below.

***89^2 - 1 = 7920 = 22 x 360 = 66 x 120 = (168 - 102) x 120***

I wondered if that property might hold for the incremental powers of phi as well. For this reason I chose to see numbers in the hexagon as quantum, and truncate off the decimal values to determine which integer cell they land in.

>That is what I found.  Phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated.

## Everything is linked

The ***ζ(s)*** will behave as ***the other universe (not the twin)*** which was initiated paralelly by a [big bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang). While this parts are relativity young. it will continue to grow as a [four-vector](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#lexer-vs-parser). So it will need a gap between each identities to proceed the thing.

>Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter. Any black hole will continually absorb gas and interstellar dust from its surroundings. This growth process is one possible way through which some supermassive black holes may have been formed _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#High-energy_collisions#Growth))_

[![Infinite number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/222023510-e57f97a6-5026-4027-b105-25a4290ed2de.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#High-energy_collisions)

By our universe it could be represented by _the central black hole_ which is very strong to throw away every objects but it has no resistance against any exchange from _[the other universe](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#rotation-vs-revolution)_. 

>In quantum field theory, the ***mass gap*** is the difference in energy between the lowest energy state, the vacuum, and the next lowest energy state. The energy of the vacuum is zero by definition, and assuming that all energy states can be thought of as particles in plane-waves, the mass gap is the mass of the lightest particle _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_gap))_.

[![the central black hole_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/104077748-9f175d00-524d-11eb-9c6d-6c0c4ee1fd93.gif)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#rotation-vs-revolution)

So by the ζ(s) then our [multiverse](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#rotation-vs-revolution) is belong to a group of multiple universes inside the ***lightest particle*** of a mass gap out of one of _[the like of them](https://legacy.quran.com/65/12)_ somewhere in an infinite number of [another parallel universes](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CmrFIXpBGsV/?igshid=OWEyOTRmYTI=).

>***[Prof Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking)'s [final research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01847.pdf) [suggests that our Universe may be one of many similar](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP04(2018)147.pdf)*** _([BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43976977))_.

[Another suggestion](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Crtd99OtzoI/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==) which has just yet been in a topic of the science is that the similar behaviour also happen by particles such as hydrogen which is throwing all of the waves ***out of the central***. So hypothetically it suppose to have a populated infinite number of its own parallel universes because whatever [a smallest thing](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cmy5WFzoujq/) is arised, they could only exist by _[the same law of physics](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cqq8s4og2LV/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=)_,

>Wave functions of the electron in a hydrogen atom at different energy levels. Quantum mechanics ***cannot predict*** the exact location of a particle in space. The brighter areas represent a higher probability of finding the electron _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics))_.

[![the electron in a hydrogen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219906653-b96d4d30-6d74-4bef-b6de-f5bc9d7fefdc.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics)
 
Consider that this law of physics would exist everywhere. So it is also one of their law when the ***[1st sequence](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#bonding-position)*** of the ten (10) digits of ***0719425863*** in Euler's number ***[is zero (0)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#zeta-vs-zero)***. Thus theoretically it speaks if _an existence of everything arose from nothingness_.
