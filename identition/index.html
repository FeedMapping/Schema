        <p>There are several open questions that need to be addressed to convert the model studied here into a realistic theory.</p><ul>  <li>First and foremost, one must find a dynamical mechanism for driving the compactification radius φ to unity to produce a small cosmological constant. Similar issue is present in the usual Kaluza–Klein scenarios where one needs to provide a mechanism for <em><a href="https://www.eq19.com/addition/#18s-structure">spontaneous compactification</a></em>. We note, however, that the situation in theory (4) is somewhat better than in the usual KK setup. In the latter case, apart from the case of compactification on S1, the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions usually does not have solutions of the form of the product of Minkowski spacetime and (compact) internal manifolds. For this reason one usually extends the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions with extra fields, e.g. by considering the Einstein–Yang–Mills system. The stress–energy tensor of these extra fields then allows for solutions of the required product form, see e.g. [20], Section 3. Probably the most famous compactification mechanism is that due to Freund and Rubin [21], where the 3-form field of the 11D supergravity is doing the job. In contrast, the theory (4) admits the solution that is the S3 fibration over S4, see [14] for an explicit description. Thus, at least there is a solution of (4) of the desired type without having to introduce extra fields. However, the cosmological constant for the S3 fibration over S4 solution is too large, see [14]. This is similar to the situation with the Freund–Rubin solution. Thus, a compactification mechanism that would result in an appropriately small cosmological constant is a very serious open issue for our setup. It is possible that the only way forward is to add other fields. We then remark that there is a very natural extension of the theory (4) that adds forms of all odd degrees. This is the theory that appeared in [12], formula (29). It would be interesting to study 4D compactifications of this more general theory. We hope to analyse this in the future.</li>  <li>Another open problem of the present approach is that of coupling to matter. Again, a natural way to proceed is suggested by supergravity. One does not couple supergravity to extra fields, one simply studies what the modes already present become when viewed from the 4D perspective. In particular, when compactifying on a coset manifold all modes related to isometries of the internal space are known to be important. Indeed, recall that the gauge group that arises in the KK compactification is the group of isometries of the internal manifold, and its dimension may be larger than the dimension of the internal space itself. In this paper we have considered a compactification on a group manifold, but only retained half of the relevant isometries by considering the invariant dimensional reduction ansatz. It is clear that additional fields will arise by enlarging the ansatz by taking into account all the isometries. In this case, however, one must be careful about <em><a href="https://www.eq19.com/addition/#undiscovered-features">the issue of consistent truncation</a></em>, see e.g. [22] for a clear description of all the issues arising. We leave a study of the dimensional reduction on S3 viewed as a coset S3 = SO(4)/SO(3) to future research.</li>  <li>Third, there is a question of how to describe Lorentzian signature metrics using this formalism. To do this one must make the 3-form C complex-valued, and then impose some appropriate reality conditions. Similar issues exist in all Plebanski-related formulations. We postpone their resolution to future work.Finally, to avoid confusion, we would like to say that our present use of G2 structures (3-forms in 7D) is different from what one can find in the literature on Kaluza–Klein compactifications of supergravity.</li></ul><p>In our approach a 3-form is not an object that exist in addition to the metric — it is the only object that exist. The metric, and in particular the 4D metric, is defined by the 3-forvia (2). Also, in the supergravity context a 7D manifold with a G2 structure is used for compactifying the 11D supergravity down to 4D. In contrast, we compactify from 7D to 4D. <em>(<a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14064088/1-s2.0-S0370269317304926-main.pdf">General relativity from three-forms in seven dimensions - pdf</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>One of the most promising attempts to go beyond the standard model of particle physics is superstring theory. As it is well known, special relativity fused time and space together, then came general relativity and introduced a curvature to space-time. Kaluza and later on Klein added one more dimension to the classical four in order to unify general relativity and electromagnetism. The dimensionality of space-time plays a paramount role in the theoretical physics of unification and has led to the introduction of the 26 dimensions of string theory, the 10 dimensions of superstring theory, and finally the heterotic string theory with the dimensional hierarchy 4, 6, 10, 16 and 26</p></div>

        <p>In this article I am going to introduce the main results of a new theory of elemetary particle physics developed by the engineer M.S. El Nachie.</p><ul>  <li>This theory provides a fractal model of quantum space-time, the so-called E-infinity space, that allows the precise determination of the mass-energy of most elementary particles -and much more- in close agreement with their experimental values.</li>  <li>The <a href="https://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/golden-ratio">Golden Ratio</a> emerges naturally in this theory, and <strong><em>turns out to be the central piece</em></strong> that connects the fractal dimension of quantum space-time with the mass-energy of every fundamental particle, and also with several fundamental physical quantities such as the Fine Structure constant.</li>  <li>El Nachie has been severely criticised by his non-orthodoxal publication methods -he uses to publish his papers in a Journal where he is the editor in chief. Despite this fact, I think that his theory deserves consideration so I will try to summarize it in the lines that follow.</li>  <li>The intervention of the Golden Ratio can be seen as a way to enter the quantum world, the world of subtle vibrations, in which we observe increasing energy levels as we move to smaller and smaller scales.</li>  <li>El Nachie has proposed a way of calculating the fractal dimension of quantum space-time. The resulting value (Figure 7) suggests that the quantum world is composed of an infinite number or scaled copies of our ordinary 4-dimensional space-time.</li>  <li>Setting k=0 one obtains the classical dimensions of <strong><em>heterotic superstring theory</em></strong>, namely 26, 16, 10, 6 and 4, as well as the constant of super-symmetric (αgs=26) and <strong><em>non super-symmetric (αg=42) unification of all fundamental forces</em></strong>.</li></ul><p>As we have seen in section 2, the above is a Fibonacci-like sequence with a very concise geometrical interpetation related to numbers <strong><em>5, 11 and φ</em></strong>. <em>(<a href="https://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/phi-particle-physics">Phi in Particle Physics</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>The standard model involves particle symmetry and the mechanism of its breaking. Modern cosmology is based on inflationary models with baryosynthesis and dark matter/energy, which involves physics beyond the standard model. Studies of the physical basis of modern cosmology combine direct searches for new physics at accelerators with its indirect non-accelerator probes, in which cosmological consequences of particle models play an important role. The cosmological reflection of particle symmetry and the mechanisms of its breaking are the subject of the present review. <em>(<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/8/8/81">MDPI</a>)</em></p></div>

The choice of closed surface does not matter.</li>  <li>These mathematical rules for what does and does not flow across any closed surface, in fact, thereby impose very stringent dynamical constraints on the behaviors of these non-Abelian magnetic sources: No matter what flows across various open surfaces, they may never be a net flux of anything across any closedsurface.

Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]</li>  <li>Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)… (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).</li>  <li>Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1’s, 3’s, 7’s, and 9’s. This is also true of the terminating digits of the first eight members of our domain (17137939).</li>  <li>Echoing the Fibonacci patterns just described, the terminating digits of the prime roots (17,137,939), when added to their reversal (93,973,171) = 111,111,110. [And note that 111,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 12345678876543210.].</li>  <li>Yet another related dimension of symmetry: The terminating digits of the prime root angles (24,264,868; see illustration of <a href="https://primesdemystified.com/#primespiralsieve">Prime Spiral Sieve</a>) when added to their reversal (86,846,242) = 111,111,110, not to mention this sequence possesses symmetries that dovetail perfectly with the prime root and Fibo sequences.</li></ul><p>And when you combine the terminating digit symmetries described above, capturing <strong><em>three (3) rotations</em></strong> around the sieve in their actual sequences, you produce the ultimate combinatorial symmetry. <em>(<a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf">PrimesDemystified</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>In this article, we investigated the <strong><em>phenomenology of triplet Higgs bosons in the simplest A4-symmetric version</em></strong> of the Higgs Triplet Model (A4HTM). The A4HTM is a four-Higgs- Triplet-Model (δ of 1 and (∆x, ∆y, ∆z) of 3).</p><ul>  <li>Four mass eigenstates of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13276480_Higgs_triplets_in_the_standard_model">doubly charged</a> Higgs bosons, H±±i, are obtained explicitly from the Higgs potential.</li>  <li>We also obtained four mass eigenstates of the triplet-like singly charged Higgs bosons, H±T i, for which doublet components can be ignored because of small triplet vev’s.</li>  <li>It was shown that the A4HTM gives unique predictions about their decay branching ratios into two leptons (H−−i → ℓℓ′ and H−iT → ℓν); for example, the leptonic decays of H−−2 are only into µµ and eτ because an approximate Z3 symmetry remains, and the ratio of the branching ratios is 2 : 1 as a consequence of the A4 symmetry in the original Lagrangian.</li>  <li>Therefore, it will be possible to test the model at hadron colliders (Tevatron and LHC) if some of these Higgs bosons are light enough to be produced.</li>  <li>Even if these Higgs bosons are too heavy to be produced at hadron colliders, they can affect the lepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons if the triplet Yukawa coupling constants are large enough.</li>  <li>It was shown that there is no contribution of these Higgs bosonsto µ → eee ¯ and ℓ → ℓ′γ.</li>  <li>Thus, we can naturally expect signals of τ → µee and τ → eµµ(which are possible in this model among six τ → ℓℓ′ℓ′′) in the future in collider experiments (Super-KEKB, super B factory, super flavor factory, and LHCb) without interfering with a stringent experimental bound on µ → eee ¯ . This model will be excluded if ℓ → ℓ ′γ is observed.</li></ul><p>We considered current experimental constraints on the model and prospects of the measurement of the non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in the neutrino factory. If H±±2 or H±±3 is lighter enough than other H±±i, effects of the NSI can be around the expected sensitivity in the neutrino factory. <em>(<a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14442049/1005.5338.pdf">Triplet Higgs bosons - pdf</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>We have shown that the SU(2)L triplet Higgs suggested by the CDF W -boson mass anomaly, significantly improve the gauge coupling unification compared to the SM case if the triplet Higgs is a complex field and exists around the TeV scale.</p><ul>  <li>This leads to the three SM gauge couplings unifying rather precisely at around 1014 GeV. The light SU(2)L triplet Higgs required by the gauge coupling unification can be realized consistently within the framework of SU(5) grand unified theory (see Appendix B).</li>  <li>This complex triplet Higgs contains one CP-even Heavy Higgs, one CP-odd Higgs and two charged Higgs bosons, which could be the smoking gun single of this scenario.</li>  <li>Although the unification scale around 1014 GeV is too low, in the usual sense, leading to significant proton decay constraints, we have shown that the constrains can be avoided by introducing additional vector-like fermions which mix with the SM fermions through an SU(5) breaking mass term.</li>  <li>Importantly, the minimal requirement is quite simple and only requires the addition of a single pair of 10 and 10 fermions to mix with the first generation 10 matter multiplet.</li>  <li>To get enough suppression in the proton decay rate, the SU(2)L singlet quark should have significant mixing with the vector-like fermion while SU(2) doublet quark should have almost zero mixing with it (or vice versa).</li>  <li>Interestingly, this leads to a suppression in the proton decay mediated by X gauge bosons but leads to a significant enhancement in the proton decay through the colored Higgs boson. This means that if nature is realized by this minimal model, it is bound to show up in proton decay experiments eventually.</li>  <li>Although this model has some additional fine tuning, the fine-tuning of the fermion masses is similar in nature to the doublet-triplet splitting present in all GUT models.</li></ul><p>Since the fine-tuning for all the fields in our model, including the light complex SU(2)L triplet, are similar in design to the doublet-triplet splitting, it is possible that all the required tuning of this GUT theory is solved by a single lmechanism, e.g. product group unification scenarios. <em>(<a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14412652/2205.03877.pdf">W boson mass anomaly and grand unification - pdf</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>Supersymmetry and more specifically supergravity grand unification allow one to extrapolate physics from the electroweak scale up to the grand unification scale consistent with electroweak data.</p><ul>  <li>Here we give a brief overview of their current status and show that the case for supersymmetry is stronger as a result of the Higgs boson discovery with a mass measurement at ∼ 125 GeV consistent with the supergravity grand unification prediction that the Higgs boson mass lie below 130 GeV. Thus the discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its mass provide a further impetus for the search for sparticles to continue at the current and future colliders.</li>  <li>The group SO(10) as the framework for grand unification appears preferred over SU(5). The group SO(10) contains both G(4, 2, 2) and SU(5)⊗U(1) as subgroups, i.e., SO(10) has the branchings SO(10) → SU(4)C ⊗ SU(2)L ⊗ SU(2)R and SO(10) → SU(5) ⊗ U(1).<a href="https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/225830554-007fbd06-9d7d-44e8-867d-c7b0188bf488.png" alt="Mystery of the First 1000 Prime Numbers" /></a></li>  <li><strong><em>It possesses a spinor representation which is 2⁵ = 32 dimensional and which splits into 16 ⊕ 16</em></strong>. A full generation of quarks and leptons can be accommodated in a single 16 plet representation. Thus the 16 plet has the decomposition in SU(5) ⊗ U(1) so that 16 =10(−1) ⊕ 5(3) ⊕ 1(−5).</li>  <li>As noted the combination 5 ⊕ 10 in SU(5) is anomaly free and further 1(−5) in the 16-plet decomposition is a right handed neutrino which is a singlet of the standard model gauge group and thus the 16-plet of matter in SO(10) is anomaly free.</li>  <li>The absence of anomaly in this case is the consequence of a more general result for SO(N) gauge theories. Thus in general anomalies arise due to the non-vanishing of the trace over the product of three group generators in some given group representation Tr ({Ta, Tb}Tc).</li>  <li>For SO(10) one will have Tr ({Σµν, Σαβ}Σλρ). However, there is no invariant tensor to which the above quantity can be proportional which then automatically guarantees vanishing of the anomaly for SO(10). This analysis extends to other SO(N) groups.</li>  <li><strong><em>One exception is SO(6) where there does exist a six index invariant tensor</em></strong> ǫµναβλρ and so in this case vanishing of the anomaly is not automatic.</li>  <li>The group SO(10) is rank 5 where as the standard model gauge group is rank 4. The rank of the group can be reduced by either using <strong><em>16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs fields or 126 ⊕ 126 of Higgs</em></strong>.</li>  <li>Since under SU(5) ⊗ U(1) one has 16 ⊃ 1(−5) we see that a VEV formation for the singlet will reduce the rank of the group. Similarly 126 ⊃ 1(−10) under the above decomposition. Thus when the singlets in 16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs or 126 ⊕ 126 get VEVs, the SO(10) gauge symmetry will break reducing its rank.</li>  <li>However, we still need to reduce the remaining group symmetry to the Standard Model gauge group. For this we need to have additional Higgs fields such as 45, 54, 210. Further to get the residual gauge group SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em we need to have 10 -plet of Higgs fields.</li>  <li>Thus the breaking of SO(10) down to SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em <strong><em>requires at least three (3) sets of Higgs representations</em></strong>: one to reduce the rank, the second to break the rest of the gauge group to the Standard Model gauge group and then at least one 10-plet to break the electroweak symmetry.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04892-x"><img src="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/ac0b2608-24b2-4a0d-bae8-55473a8576d9" alt="Higgs fields" /></a></li>  <li>As discussed above one can do this by a combination of fields from the set: 10, 16 ⊕ 16, 45, 54, 120, 126 ⊕ 126, 210.</li>  <li>To generate quark and lepton masses we need to couple two 16-plets of matter with Higgs fields. <strong><em>To see which Higgs fields couple we expand the product 16⊗16 as a sum over the irreducible representations of SO(10)</em></strong>.</li></ul><p>Here we have <strong><em>16 ⊗ 16 = 10s ⊕ 120a ⊕ 126s</em></strong>, where the s(a) refer to symmetric (anti-symmetric) under the interchange of the two 16-plets. The array of Higgs bosons available lead to a large number of possible SO(10) models. <em>(<a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14413665/1709.09718.pdf">Superunification - pdf</a>)</em></p></div>

This is not surprising, as N = 8 supergravity contains six independent representations of N = 4 super Yang–Mills.</li>  <li>The theory contains 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton">graviton</a> (spin 2), 8 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitinos">gravitinos</a> (spin 3/2), 28 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson">vector bosons</a> (spin 1), 56 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermions">fermions</a> (spin 1/2), 70 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_fields">scalar fields</a> (spin 0) where we don’t distinguish particles with negative spin.</li>  <li>These numbers are simple combinatorial numbers that come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Triangle">Pascal’s Triangle</a> and also the number of ways of writing n as a sum of 8 nonnegative cubes <a href="https://oeis.org/A173681">A173681</a>.</li>  <li>The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as String Theory and Higher-Spin Theories). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_History_of_Time">Brief History of Time</a> speculated that this theory could be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Everything">Theory of Everything</a>.<a href="https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/11/15/another-look-at-integrating-the-pascal-triangle-to-clifford-algebra-e8-lie-al"><img src="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/d821d38a-3787-473f-a83a-23ea2afd45b9" alt="ToEsummary1" /></a></li>  <li>One reason why the theory was abandoned was that <strong><em>the 28 vector bosons</em></strong> which form an O(8) gauge group is too small to contain the standard model U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3) gauge group, which can only fit within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group">orthogonal group</a> O(10).</li></ul><p>For model building, it has been assumed that almost all the supersymmetries would be broken in nature,[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify">why?</a>] leaving just one supersymmetry (N = 1), although nowadays because of the lack of evidence for N = 1 supersymmetry higher supersymmetries are now being considered such as N = 2. <em>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_%3D_8_supergravity">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p></div>
