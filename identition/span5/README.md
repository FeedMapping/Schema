A lexer is the part of an interpreter that turns a sequence of characters (plain text) into a sequence of tokens. The Parser which takes the tokens from the lexer and returns a syntax tree based on a grammar. The grammar is often expressed in a meta language.

Usage: mv [-finT] SOURCE DEST
or: mv [-fin] SOURCE... { -t DIRECTORY | DIRECTORY }

Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCEs to DIRECTORY

	-f	Don't prompt before overwriting
	-i	Interactive, prompt before overwrite
	-n	Don't overwrite an existing file
	-T	Refuse to move if DEST is a directory
	-t DIR	Move all SOURCEs into DIR

By this modification we are going to build the three (3) layers of 19 cells with a ***cumulative sum of 1, 7 and 19*** in sequence. So follow to the scheme then it would get 50 nodes out of the total nodes of 66.

The next step we will explore to find out if this configuration is relevant in the programming process. The following will explain how the formations are arranged so that we can simulate an instance based on their respective characters.

By The Δ(19 vs 18) Scenario those three are exactly landed in the 0's cell out of Δ18. See that the sum of 30 and 36 is 66 while the difference between 36 and 102 is also 66.
