For some Enneagram theorists the lines connecting the points add further meaning to the information provided by the descriptions of the types. Sometimes called the "security" and "stress" points, or points of "integration" and "disintegration".

>From this perspective, there are twenty-seven (27) distinct personality patterns, because people of each of the nine (9) types also express themselves as one of the three (3) subtypes _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Instinctual_subtypes))_.

This is managed within _[twelve (12) flows (A: to W:)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-grammar-md)_. Each flows is representing a certain period which is converting ***the three (3) layers of 19 cells*** with a cumulative sum of 1, 7 and 19 in sequence as explained before.

It turns out itâ€™s actually pretty straight forward to set WSL to [use your Windows home directory](https://jeremyskinner.co.uk/2018/07/27/sharing-home-directory-between-windows-and-wsl/). First, within WSL edit the /etc/passwd file (eg with sudo nano /etc/passwd). 

```
eq19:x:1000:1000:eQ19:/home/eq19:/bin/bash
eq19:x:1000:1000:eQ19:/mnt/c/users/Admin:/bin/bash
```
