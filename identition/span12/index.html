Even more annoyingly, both quantum mechanics and relativity are very solidly proven to be true.</li>  <li>Cosmologists found dark matter and then dark energy. They can describe their observed properties - point out that about 96% of everything is dark matter/energy - and then leave particle physicists with a major problem.</li>  <li>The demands of theoreticians for more data has pushed particle colliders to somewhere <strong><em>close to the limits of our ability</em></strong> to pay for the darned things (although not yet the limits of theoretical feasibility).</li>  <li>The construction of something significantly bigger than the Large Hadron Collider does not seem likely right now  so the data we have may turn out to be the only data we’ll ever have (from particle colliders). Large space telescopes, however, are getting MUCH better and when SpaceX get their StarShip to fly - they’ll be much cheaper and MUCH larger. So getting help from cosmologists MIGHT offer assistance.</li>  <li>The great hope that String Theory could be the “Theory of Everything” has somewhat tarnished. The last “Superstring revolution” was impressive but it was close to 30 years ago now and we still don’t seem to be adopting it as The Truth.</li>  <li>String theory predicts that one out of 10⁵ possible realities is the one we live in but fails to mention which one! This is not exactly useful!</li>  <li>Current string theories seem <strong><em>incompatible with dark energy</em></strong> - which is definitely not good.</li></ul><p>There is an additional problem called <strong><em>Background Independence</em></strong> - which is a property that Relativity requires - but which string theory does not seem to reproduce… but this is still a matter of contention. (I confess I do not understand what “Background Independence” actually is… but I Am Not A Theoretical Physicist.) <em>(<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-the-theory-of-everything/answer/Steve-Baker-100?ch=15&amp;oid=1477743656568813&amp;share=49865320&amp;srid=Yz5Fe&amp;target_type=answer">Quora</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>The helicity of a particle is positive (“right-handed”) if the direction of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)">spin</a> is the same as the direction of its motion. It is negative (“left-handed”) if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock">clock</a>, with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, has left-handed helicity if tossed with its face directed forwards.</p><ul>  <li>Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)">spin</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)">vector</a> onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum">momentum</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)">vector</a>: <strong><em>“left” is negative, “right” is positive.have mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames</em></strong>.</li>  <li>Chiral theories: Particle physicists have only observed or inferred left-chiral fermions and right-chiral antifermions engaging in the charged weak interaction.[1] In the case of the weak interaction, which can in principle engage with both left- and right-chiral fermions, only two left-handed fermions interact. Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, <strong><em>implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality</em></strong>. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.</li>  <li>Chirality for a Dirac fermion ψ is defined through the operator γ5, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue’s sign is equal to the particle’s chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its <strong><em>left- or right-handed</em></strong> component by acting with the projection operators.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model"><img src="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/6a9a0f44-a1ed-41e5-878f-62948c19d9de" alt="Right_left_helicity svg" /></a></li>  <li>The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction’s parity symmetry violation.</li>  <li>A common source of confusion is due to conflating the γ5, chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only, for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.</li>  <li>A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.</li>  <li><strong><em>The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory</em></strong>. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.</li>  <li>The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.</li></ul><p>By Chiral symmetry the Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields ψ exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:</p></div>

In nonrenormalizable effective field theory, terms in the Lagrangian do multiply to infinity, but have coefficients suppressed by ever-more-extreme inverse powers of the energy cutoff.<img src="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/a702ea20-2ef3-424f-804e-c73a6c873692" alt="169-over-109-blood-pressure" /></li>  <li>If the cutoff is a real, physical quantity—that is, if the theory is only an effective description of physics up to some maximum energy or minimum distance scale—then these additional terms could represent real physical interactions.</li>  <li>Assuming that the dimensionless constants in the theory do not get too large, one can group calculations by inverse powers of the cutoff, and extract approximate predictions to finite order in the cutoff that still have a finite number of free parameters.

        <p>This chapter is intended to provide a brief description of some important issues regarding quark masses, flavor mixing and CP-violation. A comparison between the salient features of quark and lepton flavor mixing structures is also made.</p><ul>  <li>The SM contains thirteen free flavor parameters in its electroweak sector: three charged-lepton masses,six quark masses, three quark flavor mixing angles and one CP-violating phase.</li>  <li>Since the three neutrinos must be massive beyond the SM, one has to introduce seven (or nine) extra free parameters to describe their flavor properties: three neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles and one (or three) CP-violating phase(s), corresponding to their Dirac (or Majorana) nature a</li>  <li>The <strong><em>3x3 lepton vs quark mixing matrices</em></strong> appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the <strong><em>Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)</em></strong> matrix Uand the <strong><em>Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)</em></strong> matrix V which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.</li>  <li>By convention, U and V are defined to be associated with W− and W+, respectively. Note that V is unitary as dictated by the SM itself, but whether U is unitary or not depends on the mechanism responsible for the origin of neutrino masses.</li>  <li>The charged leptons and quarks with the same electriccharges all have the normal mass hierarchies (namely, me ≪ mµ ≪ mτ, mu ≪ mc ≪ mt and md ≪ ms ≪ m. Yet it remains unclear whether the three neutrinos also have a normal mass ordering (m1 &lt; m2 &lt; m3) or not. Now that m1 &lt; m2 has been fixed from the solar neutrino oscillations, <strong><em>the only likely “abnormal” mass ordering is m3 &lt; m1 &lt; m2</em></strong></li>  <li>The neutrino mass ordering is one of the central concerns in flavor physics, and it will be determined in the foreseeable future with the help of either an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment or a reactor-based antineutrino oscillation experiment, or both of them. Up to now the moduli of nine elements of the CKM matrix V have been determined from current experimental data to a good degree of accuracy.</li></ul><p>Here our focus is on the <strong><em>five (5) parameters</em></strong> of strong and weak CP violation. In the quark sector, the strong CP-violating phase θ remains unknown, but the weak CP-violating phase δq has been determined to a good degree of accuracy. In the lepton sector, however, none of the CP-violating phases has been measured.  <em>(<a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14159651/1411.2713.pdf">Quark Mass Hierarchy and Flavor Mixing Puzzles - pdf</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>The Prime Spiral Sieve possesses remarkable structural and numeric symmetries.</p><ul>  <li>For starters, the intervals between the prime roots (and every subsequent row or rotation of the sieve) are <strong><em>perfectly balanced</em></strong>, with a period 8 difference sequence of: {6, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2}. The entire domain can thus be defined as 1 {+6 +4 +2 +4 +2 +4 +6 +2} {repeat … ∞}.</li>  <li>As we’ve already suggested, the number 30 figures large in our modulo 30 domain. The Prime Spiral Sieve is Archimedean in that the separation distance between turns equals 30, ad infinitum. The first two rotations increment as follows:<a href="https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219260933-4331d79b-5815-4566-82e3-1a485bb2c61f.png" alt="image" /></a></li>  <li>Interestingly, <strong><em>the sum of the 2nd rotation = 360</em></strong>, the product of the first three primorials, 2 x 6 x 30 = 360, and when you multiply the first five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci numbers</a> in sequence, you produce 1, 2, 6 and 30? And, speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, <strong><em>there is symmetry mirroring</em></strong> the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve:<a href="https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221473004-867a1b50-f91f-470d-9922-e5e4f543a590.png" alt="11's additive sums" /></a></li>  <li>Remarkably, the sequence of <strong><em>Fibonacci terminating digits</em></strong> indexed to our domain (natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5), <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=11020">13,937,179</a> (see graphic, above), is a prime number and a member of a twin prime pair (with 13,937,177). In case you’re wondering, 13,937,179 is not a reversible prime (as the reversal is a semi-prime: 9,461 x 10,271 = 97,173,931). However, given all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit">repunits</a> that follow, we take note that <strong><em>both of the reversal’s factors are congruent to 11 (mod 30 &amp; 90)</em></strong>. [Note: Repunits are abbreviated Rn, where n designates the number of unit 1’s. Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]</li>  <li>Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)… (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).</li>  <li>Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1’s, 3’s, 7’s, and 9’s. This is also true of the terminating digits of the first eight members of our domain (17137939).</li>  <li>Echoing the Fibonacci patterns just described, the terminating digits of the prime roots (17,137,939), when added to their reversal (93,973,171) = 111,111,110. [And note that 111,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 12345678876543210.].</li>  <li>Yet another related dimension of symmetry: The terminating digits of the prime root angles (24,264,868; see illustration of <a href="https://primesdemystified.com/#primespiralsieve">Prime Spiral Sieve</a>) when added to their reversal (86,846,242) = 111,111,110, not to mention this sequence possesses symmetries that dovetail perfectly with the prime root and Fibo sequences.</li></ul><p>And when you combine the terminating digit symmetries described above, capturing <strong><em>three (3) rotations</em></strong> around the sieve in their actual sequences, you produce the ultimate combinatorial symmetry. <em>(<a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf">PrimesDemystified</a>)</em></p></div>

        <p>Some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.</p><p>Many of these problems apply to LQG, including:</p><ul>  <li>Can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a quantum field theory)?</li>  <li>Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete?</li>  <li>Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton, or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in loop quantum gravity)?</li>  <li>Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory?</li></ul><p>The theory of LQG is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">string theory</a>. There are substantial differences however. For example, string theory also addresses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory">unification</a>, the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity, by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries. Contrary to this, LQG is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction.</p></div>

        <p>The study researchers next asked what the consequences of such a universe would be. They found many wonderful things.</p><ul>  <li>For one, a CPT-respecting <strong><em>universe naturally expands and fills itself with particles, without the need for a long-theorized period of rapid expansion known as inflation</em></strong>. While there’s a lot of evidence that an event like inflation occurred, the theoretical picture of that event is incredibly fuzzy. It’s so fuzzy that there is plenty of room for proposals of viable alternatives.</li>  <li>Second, a CPT-respecting universe would add some additional neutrinos to the mix. There are three known neutrino flavors: the electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino and tau-neutrino. <strong><em>Strangely, all three of these neutrino flavors are left-handed</em></strong> (referring to the direction of its spin relative to its motion). All other particles known to physics have both left- and right-handed varieties, so physicists have long wondered if there are additional right-handed neutrinos.</li>  <li>A CPT-respecting universe would demand the existence of <strong><em>at least one right-handed neutrino species</em></strong>. This species would be largely invisible to physics experiments, only ever influencing the rest of the universe through gravity. But an invisible particle that floods the universe and only interacts via gravity sounds a lot like dark matter.</li></ul><p>The researchers found that the conditions imposed by obeying CPT symmetry would fill our universe with right-handed neutrinos, enough to account for the dark matter. <em>(<a href="https://www.livescience.com/mirror-universe-explains-dark-matter">LiveScience</a>)</em></p></div>
