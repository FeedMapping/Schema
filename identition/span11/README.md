Speculative theories with more than one time dimension have been explored in physics. The additional dimensions may be similar to conventional time, compactified like the additional spatial dimensions in string theory, or components of a complex time

In physics, spacetime is a mathematical model that combines the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional manifold.

Spacetime diagrams can be used to visualize relativistic effects, such as why different observers perceive differently where and when events occur.

Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in November 1915, describes gravity as the warping of spacetime by masses such as the Earth and moon. The latest issue of Science News celebrates general relativity's 100th anniversary

The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit the star. The largest of such objects are the eight planets. This was formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.

```note
Zecharia Sitchin suggests that the star-shaped symbol and ***11 other dots*** on this Sumerian cylinder seal, known as VA243, represent the sun, moon and 10 planets including a mysterious "world" known as Nibiru. How could the ancient Sumerian civilization describe our solar system so accurately if it is only possible to see five planets with the naked eye? This seems impossible if we consider the science and technology needed to observe our galaxy today. If Stichin assumptions are correct, we'll see NIBIRU soon.
```

Besides many theories there is COMPOSITE and PRIMES as a self organized system (12/12/12). Even though it is proven that it is not from Tesla, whoever made it if you are reading this article, I sincerely want to thank you because I use a lot of the analysis.

This scheme has a configuration of 30 nodes so the recombination is involving 2x30 or **60 nodes** out of the 72 nodes of _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_ will act as _the base platform_. The rest of 11 which is initially _[came out](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#primes-platform)_ from **the prime 13** is the irrational.

```note
The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object. For example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a curve, a surface or some other such object in n-dimensional space _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory#Diophantine_geometry))_.

Now the following results: Due to the convolution and starting from the desired value of the prime position pairs, the product templates and prime numbers templates of _the prime number 7 lie in the numerical Double strand parallel opposite_.

Sequence:
 By the next layer the 89² will become 89 and 5 become 5² or 25.
 This 89 and 25 are in the same layer with total of 114 or prime 619
 So sequence from the first prime is 1,4,7,10,29,68,89,114,139,168,329,618.
```

When recombination is occur then the prime **13 is forced to → 12** where the impact (Δ1) goes to 18+13+12=43 on the last 7th row. This sequence is [simulated](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-implementation) by a flowchart having 12 arrows flowing on 10 (ten) shapes of prime 31 up to 71 (**40 nodes**).

_[Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson#Quantum_physics_and_prime_numbers)_ discovered an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery%27s_pair_correlation_conjecture) about the zeros of the [zeta function](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#zeta-function) which dealts with the distribution of primes.

Proceeding, the number line begins to coil upon itself; 20 lands on 2’s cell, 21 on 3’s cell. Prime number 23 sends the number line left to form the fourth hexagon, purple. As it is not a twin, the clockwise progression (rotation) reverses itself. When viewed with an extra dimension of space, these respectively generate hyperboloids of one sheet and two sheets.

The concept of dark matter arose in the study of cosmological phenomena, that is matters dealing with the Universe and galaxies and so on. However, evidence from the Hubble telescope in 1998 showed that the Universe began expanding at an accelerating rate sometime in the past and still is doing so. This came as a surprise to many

![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/220039299-b3439ba6-8479-4a72-9521-bc12b5651e85.png)

The major problem, however, is that quantum mechanical calculations for the cosmological constant give value that is grossly out of the required range. This indicates that either something is wrong with the theory, or our knowledge is incomplete.
