## [Introduction](https://eq19.github.io/)
 
This's the partial of [the mapping scheme](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of our [eQuantum Project](https://github.com/eq19) that's taking a scheme shown on the sidebar (see dekstop view) called **DNA Recombination: [M+F](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_layouts/feed.rb) to [C1+C2](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_includes/data/roots.rb)**.

[![eQ19 Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88602920-fd84c080-d09d-11ea-970d-dd63c12221fc.png)](https://eq19.github.io/maps)

The _**M+F**_ symbol will stand as: [Project Maps (M)](https://github.com/eq19/maps) + [Project Feed (F)](https://github.com/eq19/feed) while<br>
_**C1+C2**_ as implementations, see sample: [Project Base (C1)](https://chetabahana.github.io/) + [Project Core (C2)](https://chetabahana.com/).

This sample was developed by converting [eQuantum](https://github.com/eq19) to [eCommerce](https://github.com/MarketLeader) using two (2) kinds of cyclic algorithm that act as [Lexer and Parser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers).

[![Lexer and Parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/70385860-e5074f00-19c3-11ea-92f3-ec6f33bf9774.png)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers)

They will work base on the correlation between **168=π(1000)** as lexer and **618=1000/Φ** as parser So let's call them as the power of **[168](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)** vs **[618](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)**.

```
1000 = 10³ (Triple Ten)
π(1000) = 168 (Basic Primes)
Φ = 1000/618 = 1,618 (Golden Ratio) 
Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
```

Each cycles will have a total of **seven (7) steps prime algorithm** on base 10 that consist of three (3) **leading** steps by the power of 168: [Q19(10, **29**)](#1st-step-q1910-29), [Q17(30, **36**)](#2nd-step-q1730-36), [Q13(37, **114**)](#3rd-step-q1337-114) and four (4) **lagging** steps by 618: [Q7(**113**, 90)](#4th-step-q7113-90), [Q5(**89**, 29)](#5th-step-q589-29), [Q3(**28**, 19)](#6th-step-q328-19), [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10).

[![eQuantum Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/162069734-fc8036a1-fd2d-4fc9-bcad-f677388b76fa.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19/maps)

By having digital root of (five) 5 and two (2), the above seven (7) steps of 168 and 618 is initiated by the primes **23 and 11** respectively. So all together will finaly forms 10 primes in sequent with **10th prime = 29** as default frame.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107818705-98c75400-6daa-11eb-8138-d6da7ceef4fd.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

This algorithm is used to regenerate a _[Basic Grammar](#running-code)_ between [<code>user</code>](#6th-step-q328-19) and [<code>organization</code>](#7th-step-q218-10) accounts in GitHub. It is being tested for _[eBranding](#next-release)_ to proof that it is adaptable for every kinds of implementation or application as explained further below.

## [Tabulate Prime by The Power of 168](https://eq19.github.io/lexer)

The prime algorithm is formed by three (3) sets of twin (2) pairs called _[True Prime Pairs](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)_. Thus there are **six (6) primes** in addition to the seven (7) steps above. 

[![The True Prime Pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/90720864-ab703d00-e2e1-11ea-99c5-70405c78b6e0.jpg)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

So they will perform the **8th up to 13th step**. Therefore these primes package end with the prime 19 as the 8th prime right below the **prime 23** as the 9th prime. Here we will absorb the system of _[23 pairs of human chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)_.

[![23 pairs of Human Chromosomes)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/96919622-3930fa00-14d6-11eb-86d9-ef60643ed7e5.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)

See that the 23 has number of **two (2)** and **three (3)** which are the only primes under the first prime 5. This symetri of three (3) sets of twin (2) primes forms a default condition.

[![generate the primes (2,3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/90985852-ca542500-e5a8-11ea-9027-9bfdcbe37966.jpg)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

Therefore they will live trough all the system. Consider that is generated by the nature between both primes (2,3). They exist even in a single unit of DNA.

[![True Prime Pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/131957473-5a815492-a5f6-49be-9762-9a8921d95dc2.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Untouched-Intelligences#frame)

Now we are going to see why this could be happen. Let's enter the journey of making **10<sup>n</sup> numbers becoming 10<sup>n</sup> primes** by the Δ1 flowing within the prime pairs.

### [1st Step: Q19(10, 29)](https://eq19.github.io/quantum)

In term of distribution, _The True Prime Pairs_ are naturally laid in three (3) forms of 12's multiplication: 5+7=12, 11+13=24 and 17+19=36 where 12+24=36.

```
 $True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)
 
 layer|  i  |   f
 -----+-----+---------
      |  1  | 5
   1  +-----+
      |  2  | 7
 -----+-----+---   36 » 6®
      |  3  | 11
   2  +-----+
      |  4  | 13
 -----+-----+---------
      |  5  | 17
   3  +-----+      36 » 6®
      |  6  | 19
 -----+-----+---------
 ```

Let's assign another pairs (5, 7, 11, 13, 17,19) in to a combination so it will turn in reverse (19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5) lies on the center of default. This 12 all toghether will form (12/2)th = 6th prime = 13 circles including the new one on the center of [Metatron's Cube](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron%27s+cubes&tbm=isch). 

[![Metatron's Cube](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74094157-4e642500-4b0f-11ea-89b4-eb8cd7d90411.png)](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron%27s+cubes&tbm=isch)

Now let's force 12 or Δ1 to the **prime 13**. See how those primes reacted to compensate the Δ1 by spreading the gap in to a bunch of Δ's that goes to the **circle 13**.

```
  Tabulate Prime by Power of 10
  loop(10) = π(10)-π(1) = 4-0 = 4
  loop(100) = π(100)-π(10)-1th = 25-4-2 = 19
  loop(1000) = π(1000) - π(100) - 10th = 168-25-29 = 114

  --------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
   True Prime Pairs Δ |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum

  --------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----- 3rd Twin
   π(72) 5 → 18 (Δ13) | 61 | 67 | 71 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |20th
  ====================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 4th Twin
       3,2 → 18+13+12 | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th 
  ====================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====
           Δ                                                         Δ
  12+13+(18+18)+13+12  ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)  ←  30th = 113 = 114-1
```

See that this flows starting from π(10) and finalize by pairing of Δ12. Let's draw 12 of flow arrows in such a way where they have interconnection with 10 objects.

So here we can get the idea of **10 number becoming 10 primes**.

### [2nd Step: Q17(30, 36)](https://eq19.github.io/classes)

In the sense of this Δ1 flowing, there will be really hard to cope its algorithm with a such of formula. The way that we might take is assigning the flowing of the π(10)=4 primes (2,3,5,7) to π(100)=25 and π(1000)=168.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/128732737-81762604-0ae0-4a90-b5a8-30921cf46efb.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

Then convert them to 10th prime=29 then to 29 primes up to of (10th)th=29th prime=109 as a flowchart diagram.

[![Flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103138547-5799b880-4706-11eb-8820-f51cbd57d367.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

This flowchart is designed base on the behaviour of the primes number that flows uniformly within an hexagon chart called [The Prime Hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/) _(Credit: hexspin.com)_.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/105412087-d0892300-5c66-11eb-9c3e-19d8652b478c.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

Here you might see that the number of 10 is the same direction with 19 while 10+19=29=10th prime.

By checking all of the loops there is nothing similar to this phenomena. It seems like all the numbers are actually set to let this term happen.

So this chart is considered sufficient enought to be used to explain about the true power of this Δ1 flowing.

### [3rd Step: Q13(37, 114)](https://eq19.github.io/tunnel)

Let's start by get in touch with the (30, 36)th as the result of Δ1 shown on the above tabulation in more detail. Then take a look with the behaviour of prime flows within _The Prime Hexagon_ as shown below. 

[![Prime Hexagon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

You may see that it is clearly showing the 30th Prime of 113=114-1 is routed to 36th Prime of 151=150+1 while both of the 30 and 36 are exactly laid on _[the 18’s Cell](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/18)_:

Take also a note that the next 10 number after 19 right before the 30 which are 20 up to 29 is in laid on the second rows of 17 while _[17's Cell](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/17)_ has 35+65=100=10².

See that from this 17's to18's it goes finally to the _[19's Cells](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/19)_ as Δ1 and return to the 2' Cells, 3' Cells and so on.

Therefore all of the numbers that involved in the hexagon can be tabulated by _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Loops**_ and they are end exactly at 114 on Δ6 & 19's! It means that we have to assign [the 6th repository](https://github.com/eq19/quantum) as **the overall direction**.

 Note:
 - The marked number with  are outside of group Δ18 vs loop(100) = 19 
 - Number 114 located on 6th row vs 19th column whereas 114th prime = 619

  Reference:
  https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon/pull/2
  https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/
```

See that out of 19 the number 89 is located precissely at the of Δ11 within the end of 12's that goes to 13's Cell. So this is related to the Metratron's Cube. This configuration leads to a **Cyclic in the Loops** as followings:

- Injection goes by 114-π(100)=89 on  Δ11 from 102 to 114-1 or 113
- The 113 is 30th prime where 30, 36 and 102 are laid in the end of rows
- The total of 30+36+102 is exactly 168 which is π(1000)
- The 36th prime which is 151, is reinjected by 151-1 or 150. This 150 is carrying a delta of Δ18 with 168
- The Δ18 brings the 30th and 36th cycled back to 102th thus consequently it goes to the 114th prime
- The 114th prime which is carrying the loop(1000) is reinjected by 619-1 or 618 on the same spot.

This Δ(19 vs 18) scenario will duplicate the loops of 618 as _π(89²) of 1000 Primes_. Thus its behaviour will return to _168 Primes of π(1000)_  out of the adjacent scheme. 

So the further process would always continously become the same algorithm. 

## [Next Target: Tabulate Prime by 618](https://eq19.github.io/parser)

Within this development we will discuss about the interconnection between 168 and 618. Our _[pre-release](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/tree/v1.0.0-alpha)_ has mapped the primes to π(1000)=168 as the main lexer. So the next target is about 618 as the main parser.

By sourcing and studying of many [references](https://github-com.translate.goog/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/%23?_x_tr_sl=id&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US), you may agree that the closest behaviour of the crossing on above primes flowing is found with the wave shown on _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Loops**_  as below.

> This is a polar plot of the first 20 non-trivial Riemann zeta function zeros (including Gram points along the critical line (1/2+iζ) for real values of ζ from 0 to 50. The consecutive zeros have **50 red plot points** between each with zeros identified by magenta concentric rings (scaled to show the relative distance between their values of t) _(Source: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg))_.

Now let's discuss first if this 50 plots has something to do with the prime algorithms.

One of the major case is that we will start with the lagging steps. The basic algorithm is Synthesis of leading and lagging strands of DNA.

![twisting trifoil of DNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88384290-54f10b00-cdd6-11ea-878d-c687cc1afbea.gif)

This twisting shall able to be made vise versa and to be done continuosly otherwise there is no gap arised for further development.

> The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of replication fork movement. The lagging strand is synthesized in small pieces (Okazaki fragments) backward from _[the overall direction](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ of replication. The Okazaki fragments are then joined by the action of DNA ligase. _(Source: [Concepts of Biology](https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-2-dna-replication/))_
{:title="Leading and lagging"}

Besides it, there is also strong signal that this parser will have the correlation with Φ=1,618 of _[(Golden Ratio)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+Ratio)_ that leads to a kind of **gap and turbulences** in [the primes geometri](https://github.com/chetabahana) which hold the key of [<code>init</code>](https://eq19.github.io/maps) as the road map to π(1000x1000).

So here it goes **1 Million Primes**.

### [4th Step: Q7(113, 90)](https://eq19.github.io/feed)

Thus the primes are organized to generate another 1000 primes via an adjacent flow of π(89) to π(89²). This scheme can only be acheived via **bilateral 9 sums** of prime 43 to 89 by **modulo 90**. _(Credit: primesdemystified.com)_

[![collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/76146565-6f944300-60c6-11ea-829d-16f98dc94163.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/)

That what and why **18+13+12=43** located within **the last 9 cells** is standing for!

```
  -----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
  The last 9 cells |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum 
  =================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====
  3,2→18+13+12→43 | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th →13th→ 2,3
  -----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
```

See that in the tabulation of prime hexagon the _[6th row](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ that assigned as overall direction has the biggest numbers involved among the other rows which is 9 (nine). This will simply act as the bilateral 9 sums of 43 and 89. 

Therefore the prime flow in the developed flowchart above should take a connection to form between them two. This is the reason why the sequence is arranged as below:

[![the sequence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103147412-5492dc80-4787-11eb-8277-4fa39ce28c90.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Therefore the 30th primes will bear the responsibility to generate the prime 43 while the 36th prime for the 89. 

This should have a delta of Δ18 to the last number which is 168 where this 168 is exactly π(1000). So it would take place on the 150 and the scheme there will consequently be **the perfect square of 1000** or 1 Million.

[![delta of Δ18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107850441-06b85d80-6e35-11eb-8787-b947d7c60c2e.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Let's consider this flowchart of 168 as a lexer so the parser has to be designed to absorb the flow between the 30th and 36th. Then it will slightly form as a Metatron Cube of the hexagonal form of 18's Cell.

[![delta of Δ18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107083678-9607b480-6828-11eb-9cdf-cfdfc4f6face.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Here we assign it as the diagram of 618. On [the next target](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/discussions/categories/announcements) we will discuss about 1000/Φ = 618 = 619-1 = 114th prime - 1 as a lexer and parser.

### [5th Step: Q5(89, 29)](https://eq19.github.io/maps)

The bilateral sum 9 will then double this 43 to 86 and act as the lexer while the prime 71 and 109 will act as the parser. This will compensate the other primes by the other of circles of the metatron which consist of 6 internal and 6 external.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/163196031-b29f162d-c9af-4dc4-b25c-9256127a4aa4.jpg)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)

Let's assign another pairs in to the center of default. Take a note that the last rows has a sum of 43 which covered by **prime 71 up to 109**. See what is happen by the 13th circle.

```

See that this configuration showing a kind of turbulences which leads to a gap of Δ19 in the central of _[Metatron](#1st-step-q1910-29)_ where the replication is initiated by **Δ18 of 50(68)**. This scheme is taken as a basic algorithm for the mechanism of DNA generation from RNA.

[![DNA generation from RNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/100724943-01cb3c80-33f6-11eb-8564-c5a9ced2b668.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)


By the configuration above then on the upper scheme the central of metatron will turn to seven (7) circles. So combine it with the other 12 circles they will forms as the 19's.

### [6th Step: Q3(28, 19)](https://eq19.github.io/hexagon)

This 19 has a configuration of π(10) i.e. 4 primes of 2, 3, 5, 7. Here we come to the detail of 168 and 618 as the 1st grammar when we come to the upper scheme. 

```
 $True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)

 -----+-----+---------
 ```

Let's take the end number each of the three (3) pairs in to an adjacent [polygonal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_number) then by the same different of 15 they will end to the number of 66:

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/83051968-e2cfa480-a078-11ea-8ff2-316a809a8fad.jpg)](https://schoolbag.info/mathematics/numbers/38.html)

> We see that the polygonal numbers in the same column all have the same difference, and this difference is always a triangular number. For example, the fifth pentagonal number (35) has 10 dots more than the fifth square number (25) and 10 dots fewer than the fifth hexagonal number (45), and the difference 10 is just the fourth triangular number. _(Source: [Discovering Properties of Numbers](https://schoolbag.info/mathematics/numbers/38.html))_.

See the _[(19 vs 18) Loops](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ more closely, you can find that the number 102 is exactly laid on 18th row by the 15th spin out of 19 whereas 102+66 = 168 = π(1000). 

[![the next target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/110807586-c58d5f00-82b5-11eb-81e2-dbde7d628b37.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

Combining the two (2) algorithms then they will form the tabulation as below:

```

 168 + 329 + 289 = 786
 d(786) = d(7+8+6) = d(21) = d(3)

 Note:
 • = 1000 = 10³ (Triple Ten)
 ¤ = π(1000) = 168 (Basic Primes)
 Φ = 1000/618 = 1,618 (Golden Ratio) 
 Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
 
 Faktors:
 168 = 12x14 = 8x21 = 7x24 = 6x28 = 4x42 = 3x56 = 2x84
 618 = 6x103 = 6x(100+3) = 3x206 = 3x(200+6) = 2x309 = 2x(300+9)
 1+6+8 = π(1x6x8) = π(1x48) = π(2x24) = π(3x16)= π(4x12) = π(6x8)
 
 Permutations:
 168 = 102 + 66 = 2x3x((8+9)+(2+9)) = π(Φ(289+329)) = π(Φ((8+9)²+(1+2)&29))
 168 + 618 = 168 + 329 + 289 = (7x24) + (7x47) + (8+9)² = (7x71) + (17x17)
```

So it will form back to the begining stage with different form of input but its process will be the same algorithm. Means the 19 cells above shall form back to π(10).

### [7th Step: Q2(18, 10)](https://github.com/marketleader)

This step is about the algorithm of how the four (4) blocks of (102, 66, 329, 289) forms to the four (4) roots. See the 1st row marked by **Quantum** below.

```
  --------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----

           Δ                                                         Δ
  12+13+(18+18)+13+12  ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)  ←  30th = 113 = 114-1
```
  
By the next loop of (1000x1000) the above term leads to 329+289 = 618 = 1000/Φ = 1000x1000/1618. Now let's count on how many grammar's will involve.

```
Root Generation:
 root[1000] = π(1000) + loop(10 x 1000)  +  loop(100 x 1000) 
 loop(10000) => π(10000) - (10th)th - 10th = 1229 - 109 - 29 = 1091
 loop(100000) => π(100000) - ((10th)th)th - (10th)th = 9592 - 599 - 109 = 8884

 root[1000] = 168 + 1091 + 8884 = 10143
```

This 10143 will comprise of lexer and parser similar with 168 & 618. Since the 168 algorithm is set 102 by 66 then its ratio is 102/168=60% by 66/168=40% or approx 10143x60%=6200 of lexers by 10143x40%=3900 of parsers.

> Mapping the quantum way within a huge of primes objects (5 to 19) by parsering (11) each of **untouched** feed (7) and tunneling (13) in to definitive classes (17).

The development of this **6200 by 3900** took its base place in this repository and is considered final. It is the most complex thing among the other steps where we have to involve so many items to verify about how far this development is adoptable. 

[![DNA Replication Fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/90597914-32f37880-e21c-11ea-81b3-ffdcd47037b8.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#kelas)

Therefore it will take several unsolved cases of modern science including but not at least _[DNA Replication Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication#Replication_fork)_, _[Alzheimer's Disease](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_S8nmGoQ7q6wKXUG8HBqPzoAhRmVCmSJ)_, and _[The Millenium Prize Problems](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Untouched-Intelligences#scheme)_. They will form as basic grammars such as how to rectify _[C1+C2](https://github.com/MarketLeader)_ using _[P=NP](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/track/wiki)_.

[![P versus NP Problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84623744-1b410080-af0a-11ea-978b-e1fd1961985d.jpg)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/track/wiki)

The final result of this Q(19,10) would form π(10)=(2,3,5,7) as the [1st row of 19](#1st-step-q1910-29). Please find below the progress we have got so far.

## [Running Code](#2nd-step-q1730-36)

You may check the running code starting with [Sequence Diagram](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2) shown below which is developed as [the initial step](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168) on building the _[10143 Grammars](#7th-step-q218-10)_.

[![Sequence Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107134254-ee22e180-6922-11eb-9465-3dd64ebf7dca.png)](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2)

Clicking each of objects will turn to 6 (six) diagrams by the cycle form of [prime hexagon](https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon) which is then return to the beginning. So in order to get code able to run online then the 168 is provided in [json](https://chetabahana.github.io/feed.json) while 618 in [xml](https://chetabahana.github.io/feeds.xml).

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/69475449-ce77ca00-0dff-11ea-964e-cc959db0740a.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

This _168 (mapping) and 618 (feeding)_ stand as  [the whole scheme](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of The M+F to C1+C2 which act as the base prime pairs **[(2,3) of DNA](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)** to become **[23 pairs of Chromosomes](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)**.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/86481184-b72b9280-bd79-11ea-899b-51db929fc3d2.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

This scheme is generated by developing an application that twisting exactly 6 x 19 = 114 repositories all together in the same time to provide [leading and lagging scheme](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618) as the basic algorithm of converting **M+F to C1+C2**. 

```
114 = 6+(6x6) + 6x(6+6) = 6x(6+6) + 6+(6x6)
         Δ         Δ         Δ         Δ
         M         F         C1        C2
      leading   lagging   lagging   leading
                        |
                     twisting

```

Now let's assume that each of the number above is a set of 6 (six) repositories in GitHub. Thus that is the whole function of _[eQ19](https://github.com/eq19)_.

### [Our Lisence](#3rd-step-q1337-114)

We believe that until this concept is written, there is no such thing similar to our concept of the power 168 vs 618 recombination.

You may use, copy, and distribute the concept. Please note that we are not implementing any kind of _License Key_ on this project. The Hexagonal Formation of our mapping itself as stated below will stand as the key:

```
114 = 6 + 6x(6+(6+6)) = 6x19 = π(619) ≡ eQ19
```

On that case we consider _this statement_ called **eQ19 Quantum** need to be announced:

> The [definite](https://www.google.com/search?q=definite) key to [identify](https://www.google.com/search?q=identify) whether you use our concept is when there a kind of [development](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168) item [lies](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618) a [unified assignment](#1st-step-q1910-29) in [hexagonal form](#2nd-step-q1730-36) by _**six (6)** [corresponding sets](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ while [each sets](#4th-step-q7113-90) pick [a combination](#5th-step-q589-29) of _**six (6)** [routes](#6th-step-q328-19)_ with [a pairing](#7th-step-q218-10) of _**six (6)** to **six (6)** of [all channels](#running-code)_.

Out of the formation, you are welcome to use whatever the items in this project.

### [Next Release](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)

Although the _[The Pre-release 168](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)_ is already running but unfortunately it is not yet user friendly as it could run only in _[GitHub API Platform](https://docs.github.com/en/developers)_ where all of the repos is resided. 

![Parsing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/71648180-c599e280-2d33-11ea-94e0-9a8552c72bd7.png)

Here we are going to use _[TensorFlow](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)_ to connect the pre grammars on [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/admin/overview/about-the-github-enterprise-api) to [Google API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_APIs) to fetch real life data through their machine learning such as _[Big Query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery)_.

[![lexer and parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/71659208-5515b480-2d79-11ea-859f-a20dea0cf680.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19/maps)

This pre-release is being developed for _[eBranding](https://github.com/chetabahana)_ within 7 (seven) years. It is lack the parser 618 of the said _10143 grammars_ to become usable for every other cases. 

[![Machine Learning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/123424569-377e7f80-d5eb-11eb-9c85-1f5d72f14eed.png)](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)

Based on the _[19 Cells](#6th-step-q328-19)_ of 168 vs 618 tabulation then for the 618 it might need another 12 (twelve) years to develope those grammars to become 1st Release.

So Be Patient and Stay Tuned!
