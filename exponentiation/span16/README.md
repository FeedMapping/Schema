Effective field theories have been a mainstay of theoretical physics since the 1930s but they haven't helped all that much with quantum gravity.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

Here we decided to take a concept that gravity enter the event horizons of black holes and tunnel out again to deposit it into the background.

## Event horizons

## Eternal Cyclic

We would expect that the quantum theory reduces to Einstein's theory of gravity. There is no way to put a black hole into the Hamiltonian.

```note
Think of it this way, all gravitating bodies in the universe would be surrounded at all times by a cloud of tunneling electrons. We cannot see these particles since they’re so small and since they permeate all of space. They would also tunnel to a different location about once every Planck time (about 10^-43 seconds) whenever they interact with another particle.
- These interactions between particles amount to the exchanges of bosons between electrons and other electrons or other fermions. At each point where the electron absorbs another boson, we say that the wave function of the electron collapses, and it tunnels to a new location whereupon it interacts with yet another particle.
- The cloud of electron surrounding gravitating objects would diminish in inverse proportion to the square of the distance; hence, if you recede from an objects’ surface, you’re less likely to find an electron tunneling from that object.
- Electrons also make an excellent candidate for a particle of gravity since they absorb and emit photons readily, and we know from Einstein’s theory of general relativity that light interacts readily with gravitational fields, and that gravitational fields are thought to emit photons spontaneously.
- This spontaneous emission of photons is what we refer to as the cosmological constant or dark energy, and in our current thinking on the topic we imagine that particles of antimatter are created and annihilate with particles of matter leading, occasionally, to the emission of a photon. I suspect that this is incorrect and that no such thing as antimatter really exists. I suspect that positrons are really tunneling W particles and that this Dirac Sea, or background of tunneling electrons, is really giving rise to this phenomenon of the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, we observe inn nature.
- As a consequence, we would need to adumbrate our standard model of particle physics by about half. This ought to be seen as a positive thing in physics. No longer do we have untestable assumptions (such as the creation and annihilation of particles) in our models, and we have a far easier means of now beginning to probe the quantum nature of gravity.

The other fascinating consequence of this way of thinking is that gravity would no longer be a fundamental force; instead it would be a secondary effect of electromagnetism. This should have been what we anticipated all along; and now, we might have a quantum theory focusing on only three forces and a theory of gravitation that is truly particle-based. _([Medium - Article](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968))_

```note
We may gain a better understanding of black hole physics; wewe may gain the insight that tunneling electrons enter the event horizons of black holes, absorb a particle there, and tunnel out again to deposit it into the background. In this way, we could explain how black holes radiate away.  _([Medium - Article](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968))_

```note
There are two groups of scientists (called collaborations) looking for evidence of gravitons in proton-proton collision experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Once a graviton has been created, it’s expected to decay in one of a few possible ways - and it’s evidence of these decays that the collaborations are looking for. ***ATLAS search for evidence that the gravitons decays into two photons, and the CMS search for evidence that the graviton decays into two jets (bursts) of hadrons (a particular class of particle)***. _([ThingsWeDontKnow.com](https://blog.thingswedontknow.com/2016/08/search-for-the-graviton.html))_
