This section serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the [gluon fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon_field) associated with the coloured quarks in [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) of [colours of the gluon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#Eight_gluon_colours). 

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

A gauge colour rotation is _[a spacetime-dependent SU(3)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(3))_ group element. They span the [Lie algebra](https://github.com/lkpetrich/Semisimple-Lie-Algebras) of the SU(3) group in the defining representation.

## Feynman diagram

```note
In this Feynman diagram, an electron (e‚àí) and a positron (e+) annihilate, producing a photon (Œ≥, represented by the blue sine wave) that becomes a quark‚Äìantiquark pair (quark q, antiquark qÃÑ), after which the antiquark radiates a gluon (g, represented by the green helix).

So basically  there is a basic transformation between ***[addition](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)*** of `3 + 4 = 7` in to their ***[multiplication](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)*** of `3 x 4 = 12` while the 7 vs 12 will be treated as ***exponentiation***.

## Matrix Scheme

Quarks have three colors. Color is to the strong interaction as electric charge is to the electromagnetic interaction.

```

This exponentiation takes important roles since by the _[multiplication zones](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)_ the MEC30 forms a matrix of  `8 x 8 = 64 = 8¬≤` where the power of 2 stands as exponent

```note
During the last few years of the 12th century, ***Fibonacci*** undertook a series of travels around the Mediterranean. At this time, the world‚Äôs most prominent mathematicians were Arabs, and he spent much time studying with them. His work, whose title translates as the Book of Calculation, was extremely influential in that ***it popularized the use of the Arabic numerals in Europe***, thereby revolutionizing arithmetic and allowing scientific experiment and discovery to progress more quickly. _([Famous Mathematicians](https://famous-mathematicians.org/leonardo-pisano-bigollo/))_

Since the first member is 30 then the form is initiated by a matrix of `5 x 6 = 30` which has to be transformed first to `6 x 6 = 36 = 6¬≤` prior to the above MEC30's square.

Fermions and bosons‚Äîfermions have quantum spin = 1/2.
- The elementary fermions are leptons and quarks.
- There are three generations of leptons: electron, muon, and tau, with electric charge ‚àí1, and their neutrinos with no electric charge.
- There are three generations of quarks: (u, d); (c, s); and (t, b).

The (u, c, t) quarks have electric charge 2/3 while the (d, s, b) quarks have electric charge ‚àí1/3. _([IntechOpen](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/71535))_

Interactions in quantum chromodynamics are strong, so perturbation theory does not work. Therefore, Feynman diagrams used for quantum electrodynamics cannot be used.

Bosons have quantum spin = 1: photon, quantum of the electromagnetic field; gluon, quantum of the strong field; and W and Z, weak field quanta, which we do not need.

An animation of [color confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement), a property of the strong interaction. If energy is supplied to the quarks as shown, the [gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) tube connecting [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) elongates until it reaches a point where it "snaps" and the energy added to the system results in the formation of a quark‚Äì[antiquark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquark) pair. Thus single quarks are never seen in isolation. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction))_

## Interactions

The subclasses of partitions systemically develops characters similar to the distribution of prime numbers. 

```note
***Unlike the strong force, the residual strong force diminishes with distance, and does so rapidly***. The decrease is approximately as a negative exponential power of distance, though there is no simple expression known for this; see [Yukawa potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_potential). The rapid decrease with distance of the attractive residual force and the less rapid decrease of the repulsive electromagnetic force acting between protons within a nucleus, causes the instability of larger atomic nuclei, such as all those with [atomic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number) larger than 82 (the element lead). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction#Between_hadrons))_

```note
The Gell-Mann matrices, developed by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann), are a set of eight [linearly independent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence) 3√ó3 [traceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_trace) [Hermitian matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrices) used in the study of the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction) in [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics). They span the [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group) of the [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#SU(3)) group in the defining representation.
- These matrices are [traceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceless), [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix), and obey the extra trace orthonormality relation (so they can generate [unitary matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix) group elements of [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(3)) through [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential)[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-Scherer-Schindler-1)). These properties were chosen by Gell-Mann because they then naturally generalize the [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) for [SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(2)) to SU(3), which formed the basis for Gell-Mann's [quark model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_model).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-2) Gell-Mann's generalization further [extends to general SU(n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Pauli_matrices#Construction). For their connection to the [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_system) of Lie algebras, see the [Weyl‚ÄìCartan basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#Standard_basis).
- Since the eight matrices and the identity are a complete trace-orthogonal set spanning all 3√ó3 matrices, it is straightforward to find two Fierz completeness relations, (Li & Cheng, 4.134), analogous to that [satisfied by the Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Completeness_relation_2). Namely, using the dot to sum over the eight matrices and using Greek indices for their row/column indices
- A particular choice of matrices is called a [group representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation), because any element of SU(3) can be written in the form using the ***[Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation)***, where the eight 
 are real numbers and a sum over the index j is implied. Given one representation, an equivalent one may be obtained by an arbitrary unitary similarity transformation, since that leaves the commutator unchanged.
- The matrices can be realized as a representation of the [infinitesimal generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group) of the [special unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group) called [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(3)). The [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra) of this group (a real Lie algebra in fact) has dimension eight and therefore it has some set with eight [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence) generators, which can be written as 
g_{i}, with i taking values from [1 to 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-Scherer-Schindler-1)

These matrices serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the ***[gluon fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon_field) associated with the coloured quarks of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) (cf. [colours of the gluon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#Eight_gluon_colours))***. A gauge colour rotation is a spacetime-dependent SU(3) group element where summation over the eight indices (8) is implied. _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices))_

From the 50 we gonna split the 15 by _bilateral 9 sums_ resulting 2 times 15+9=24 which is 48. So the total of involved objects is ***50+48=98***.

```note
Consider the evidence: scattering experiments strongly suggest a meson to be composed of a quark anti-quark pair and a baryon to be composed of three quarks. The famous 3R experiment also suggests that whatever force binds the quarks together has 3 types of charge (called the 3 colors).
- Now, into the realm of theory: we are looking for an internal symmetry having a 3-dimensional representation which can give rise to a neutral combination of 3 particles (otherwise no color-neutral baryons).
-  The simplest such statement is that a linear combination of each type of charge (red + green + blue) must be neutral, and following William of Occam we believe that the simplest theory describing all the facts must be the correct one.
-  We now postulate that the particles carrying this force, called gluons, must occur in color anti-color units (i.e. nine of them).
- BUT, red + blue + green is neutral, which means that the linear combination red anti-red + blue anti-blue + green anti-green must be non-interacting, since otherwise the colorless baryons would be able to emit these gluons and interact with each other via the strong force‚Äîcontrary to the evidence.  So, there can only be ***EIGHT gluons***.

This is just Occam's razor again: a hypothetical particle that can't interact with anything, and therefore can't be detected, doesn't exist. The simplest theory describing the above is the SU(3) one with the gluons as the basis states of the Lie algebra.  That is, gluons transform in the adjoint representation of SU(3), which is 8-dimensional. _([Physics FAQ](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/gluons.html))_

In mathematics, orthonormality typically implies a norm which has a value of unity (1). Gell-Mann matrices, however, ***are normalized to a value of 2***.
- Thus, the [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)) of the pairwise product results in the ortho-normalization condition where delta is the [Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta).
- This is so the embedded Pauli matrices corresponding to the three embedded subalgebras of SU(2) are conventionally normalized.
- In this three-dimensional matrix representation, the [Cartan subalgebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_subalgebra) is the set of linear combinations (with real coefficients) of the two matrices which commute with each other.

The SU(2) Casimirs of these subalgebras ***mutually commute***. However, any unitary similarity transformation of these subalgebras will yield SU(2) subalgebras. There is an uncountable number of such transformations. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices))_
