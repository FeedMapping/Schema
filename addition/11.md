## Mobius Strip

There are some mathematical shape of this residual objects. [Torus](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#the-crank-of-a-partition) is basically a donut shape, which has the property of of having variable Gaussian curvature. 

```note
The blue parts of the torus above have positive curvature, the red parts negative and the top grey band has zero curvature.  If our 3 dimensional space was like the surface areas of a 4 dimensional torus, the parts would have different angle sums.
```

Some parts of the surface has positive curvature, others zero, others negative.

If you start anywhere on its surface and follow the curvature round you will eventually return to the same place having travelled on every part of the surface.

Mobius strip only has one side, there are two more bizarre shapes with strange properties. 

## The Klein bottle 

The Klein bottleis in someways a 3D version of the Mobius strip and even though it exists in 3 dimensions, to make a true one you need to “fold through” the 4th dimension.

```note
In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the Klein bottle ([/ˈklaɪn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) is an example of a [non-orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability) [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)); that is, informally, a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down.
- More formally, the Klein bottle is a [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional) [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold) on which one cannot define a [normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector) at each point that varies [continuously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function) over the whole manifold.
- Other related non-orientable surfaces include the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip) and the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane). 

While a Möbius strip is a surface with a [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology)), a Klein bottle has no boundary. For comparison, a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere) is an orientable surface with no boundary.

## The Spinors

A spinor associated to the conformal group of the circle, exhibiting a sign inversion on a full rotation of the circle through an angle of 2π.

```tip
This behaviour finaly brings us to a suggestion that the dimension in string theory are linked with ***the prime distribution level*** as indicated by the _[self repetition](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)_ on MEC30.
```

***7th spin - 4th spin = (168 - 102)s = 66s = 6 x 11s = 30s + 36s***

This model may explains the newly discovered prime number theorem in relatively simple layman's terms for anyone with a slight background in theoretical physics. 

```note
The property gives an in depth analysis of the not so random distribution of primes by showing how it has solved Goldbach's conjecture and the Ulam spiral.
```

The model suggests a possible origin for both charge and half-integer spin and also reconciles the apparently contradictory criteria discussed above.

Under certain conditions, energy could not take on any indiscriminate value, the energy must be some multiple of a very small quantity (later to be known as a ***quantum***).
