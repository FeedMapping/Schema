***The number 120 = MEC30 x 4 has 32 prime positions minus 5 prime number products = 27 prime numbers***. The information of the prime number products translates our theory into a checkerboard-like pattern using the finite 8 prime positions from the MEC 30, we call it Ikon. 8 × 8 primary positions = 64 primary positions of the checkerboard icon.

```note
Note that the hexagon in the middle has 37 circles and the total figure, a star of David has 73. For this one you go around one point of the pattern in a circle until you go past a letter that you have already covered. For instance in B-R-A-Sh you will have to switch the position for the Sh because it moves more than through the alphabet. S-I-T does the same with the T.

## Composite Contribution 

The above seven (7) primes will act then as ***[extended branes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane)***. This is what we mean by ***addition zones*** and it happens whenever a cycle is restarted.

This scheme goes to the unification of 11s with 7s to 18s meanwhile the 11th it self behave as residual by the 5th minor hexagon between the ***[30 to 36' cells](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#fundamental-forces)***.

By _[The Δ(19 vs 18) Scenario](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#%CE%B419-vs-18-scenario)_ those three are exactly landed in the ***0's cell*** out of Δ18. See that the sum of 30 and 36 is 66 while the difference between 36 and 102 is also 66.

```note
You likely noticed I began with 2 rather than 1 or 0 when I first constructed the hexagon. Why? Because they do not fit inside — they stick off the hexagon like a tail. Perhaps that’s where they belong. However, if one makes a significant and interesting assumption, then 1 and 0 fall in their logical locations – in the 1 and 0 cells, respectively. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/0-1-and-negative-numbers/))

```tip
This behaviour finaly brings us to a suggestion that the dimension in string theory are linked with ***the prime distribution level*** as indicated by the _[self repetition](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)_ on MEC30.
```

***7th spin - 4th spin = (168 - 102)s = 66s = 6 x 11s = 30s + 36s***

It will be forced back to Δ19 making a cycle that bring back **the 12 to → 13** of 9 collumns and replicate _[The Scheme 13:9](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#scheme-139)_ through **(i=9,k=13)=9x3=27** with entry form of (100/50=2,60,40) as below:

The 10 ranks will coordinate with the 18 to raise up the symmetrical behaviour of 12+24=36 which is prime pair 17+19=36 and let the 2 and 3 out of 2,3,5,7 to begin a new cycle while the 5,7 will pair the 11,13 and 17,19 as _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_.

I like that 0 can occupy a center point.  Incidentally, this circular shape minus all my numbers and colors s has been called Seed of Life / Flower of Life by certain New Age groups who claim it has a sacred geometry.  Please don’t see this as an endorsement of any spiritual group or religion. _([Prime Hexagon - Circulat Form](https://www.hexspin.com/circular/))_
