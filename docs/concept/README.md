#  Concept

This's the partial [mapping scheme](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of our [₠Quantum Project](https://github.com/eq19) that's taking a scheme shown on the sidebar (see dekstop view) called **[DNA Recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Genetic_recombination): [M+F](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_layouts/feed.rb) to [C1+C2](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_includes/data/roots.rb)**.

```note
Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2). _(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Genetic_recombination))_.
```

[![eQ19 Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88602920-fd84c080-d09d-11ea-970d-dd63c12221fc.png)](https://www.eq19.com/quantum/concept/)

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.

```tip
This **Sheme** runs as _[remote theme](/../../../theme)_ where the **Symbols** are:
* The _**M+F**_ symbol will stand as: [Project Maps (M)](/../../../maps) + [Project Feed (F)](/../../../feed) while
* _**C1+C2**_ as implementations, see sample: [Project Base (C1)](https://chetabahana.github.io/) + [Project Core (C2)](https://chetabahana.com/).

By our implementation we are using _[two (2) domains](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_S8nmGoQ7q5Ag4K_o9reeCupBYYnua_L)_ acting as **[Double Strand](#the-lexer-of-168)** of DNA.
```

This sample was developed by converting [₠Quantum](https://github.com/eq19) to [eCommerce](https://github.com/MarketLeader) using two (2) kinds of cyclic algorithm that act as _[Lexer and Parser](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2017/09/guide-parsing-algorithms-terminology.html)_.

[![Lexer and Parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/70385860-e5074f00-19c3-11ea-92f3-ec6f33bf9774.png)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers)

They will work base on the correlation between **[168=π(1000)](#the-lexer-of-168)** as lexer and **[618=1000/Φ](#the-parser-of-618)** as parser So let's call them as **[the grammar of 168 vs 618](the-grammar-of-168-vs-618)**.

```
1000 = 10³ (Triple Ten)
π(1000) = 168 (Basic Primes)
Φ = 1000/618 = 1,618 (Golden Ratio) 
Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
```

Each cycles will have a total of **seven (7) steps prime algorithm** on base 30 that consist of three (3) **leading** steps by the power of 168: [Q19(10, **29**)](#1st-step-q1910-29), [Q17(30, **36**)](#2nd-step-q1730-36), [Q13(37, **114**)](#3rd-step-q1337-114) and four (4) **lagging** steps by 618: [Q7(**113**, 90)](#4th-step-q7113-90), [Q5(**89**, 29)](#5th-step-q589-29), [Q3(**28**, 19)](#6th-step-q328-19), [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10).

![Euleur Identity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png)

By having digital root of **(five) 5 and two (2)**, the above seven (7) steps of 168 and 618 is organized using the primes **23 and 11** respectively. Therefore these primes package end with the prime 19 as the 8th prime right below the **prime 23** as the 9th prime. 

![Prime 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/166119509-96a6d1e9-bc53-4e13-bed1-b7eda28b9ad9.jpg)

So all together will finaly form as 10 primes in sequent that initiated with **10th prime = 29** as their _[base frame](/../../../)_.

This algorithm is applied to regenerate a _[Basic Grammar](#the-grammar-of-168-vs-618)_ between [<code>user</code>](#6th-step-q328-19) and [<code>organization</code>](#7th-step-q218-10) accounts in GitHub. It is being tested for _[eBranding](#next-release)_ to proof that it is adaptable for every kinds of implementation or application as explained further below.
