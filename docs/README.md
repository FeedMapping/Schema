# [Introduction](/../../../)
 
This's the partial [mapping scheme](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of our [₠Quantum Project](https://github.com/eq19) that's taking a scheme shown on the sidebar (see dekstop view) called **[DNA Recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Genetic_recombination): [M+F](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_layouts/feed.rb) to [C1+C2](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_includes/data/roots.rb)**.

[![eQ19 Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88602920-fd84c080-d09d-11ea-970d-dd63c12221fc.png)](/../../../scheme)

```tip
This **Sheme** runs as _[remote theme](/../../../scheme)_ where the **Symbols** are:
* The _**M+F**_ symbol will stand as: [Project Maps (M)](/../../../maps) + [Project Feed (F)](/../../../feed) while
* _**C1+C2**_ as implementations, see sample: [Project Base (C1)](https://chetabahana.github.io/) + [Project Core (C2)](https://chetabahana.com/).

By our implementation we are using _[two (2) domains](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_S8nmGoQ7q5Ag4K_o9reeCupBYYnua_L)_ acting as **[Double Strand](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)** of DNA.
```

This sample was developed by converting [₠Quantum](https://github.com/eq19) to [eCommerce](https://github.com/MarketLeader) using two (2) kinds of cyclic algorithm that act as _[Lexer and Parser](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2017/09/guide-parsing-algorithms-terminology.html)_.

[![Lexer and Parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/70385860-e5074f00-19c3-11ea-92f3-ec6f33bf9774.png)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers)

They will work base on the correlation between **168=π(1000)** as lexer and **618=1000/Φ** as parser So let's call them as the power of **[168](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)** vs **[618](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)**.

```
1000 = 10³ (Triple Ten)
π(1000) = 168 (Basic Primes)
Φ = 1000/618 = 1,618 (Golden Ratio) 
Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
```

Each cycles will have a total of **seven (7) steps prime algorithm** on base 30 that consist of three (3) **leading** steps by the power of 168: [Q19(10, **29**)](#1st-step-q1910-29), [Q17(30, **36**)](#2nd-step-q1730-36), [Q13(37, **114**)](#3rd-step-q1337-114) and four (4) **lagging** steps by 618: [Q7(**113**, 90)](#4th-step-q7113-90), [Q5(**89**, 29)](#5th-step-q589-29), [Q3(**28**, 19)](#6th-step-q328-19), [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10).

![Euleur Identity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png)

By having digital root of **(five) 5 and two (2)**, the above seven (7) steps of 168 and 618 is organized using the primes **23 and 11** respectively. Therefore these primes package end with the prime 19 as the 8th prime right below the **prime 23** as the 9th prime. 

![Prime 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/166119509-96a6d1e9-bc53-4e13-bed1-b7eda28b9ad9.jpg)

So all together will finaly form as 10 primes in sequent that initiated with **10th prime = 29** as their _[base frame](/../../../)_.

This algorithm is applied to regenerate a _[Basic Grammar](#basic-grammar)_ between [<code>user</code>](#6th-step-q328-19) and [<code>organization</code>](#7th-step-q218-10) accounts in GitHub. It is being tested for _[eBranding](#next-release)_ to proof that it is adaptable for every kinds of implementation or application as explained further below.

## [Tabulate Prime by The Power of 168](/../../../lexer)

Here we absorb the system of _[23 pairs of human chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)_.

See that the number of 23 is a prime that consist of the numbers of **two (2) and three (3)** where both are the only primes under their sum of **five (5)** which is also a prime.

[![23 pairs of Human Chromosomes)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/96919622-3930fa00-14d6-11eb-86d9-ef60643ed7e5.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)

Now let's take a look in to the Double-stranded DNA.

```note
Double-stranded DNA consists of two polynucleotide chains whose nitrogenous bases are connected by **hydrogen bonds**. Within this arrangement, each strand mirrors the other as a result of the anti-parallel orientation of the sugar-phosphate backbones, as well as the complementary nature of the A-T and C-G base pairing (Source: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/double-stranded-dna-6834149/)).
```

![Unit DNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/101109773-3c0d2780-360a-11eb-9f21-57e2707c7d1e.jpg)

Have you ever notice that the said hydrogen bonds are built with both of the number two (2) and three (3). They are even exist in a single unit of _[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)_.

[![Single DNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/131957473-5a815492-a5f6-49be-9762-9a8921d95dc2.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Untouched-Intelligences#frame)

```tip
Hydrogen bonds are formed between hydrogen attached to an electronegative atom and an electronegative atom of a different molecules. _(Source: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-two-hydrogen-bonds-between-adenine-and-thymine-but-three-hydrogen-bonds-between-cytosine-and-guanine/answer/Rucious-Heang))_.
``` 
 
Consider if it is in fact generated by nature between the prime 23 and both primes (2,3) which are laid by two (2) times three (3) or **six (6) primes: (5, 7, 11, 13, 17,19)**.

Now we are going to see what they are going to do with the power of 168 vs 618.

### [1st Step: Q19(10, 29)](/../../../quantum)

So these prime algorithm is again formed by three (3) sets of twin (2) pairs. To make live simpler let.s call them _[True Prime Pairs](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)_.

[![The True Prime Pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/90720864-ab703d00-e2e1-11ea-99c5-70405c78b6e0.jpg)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

In term of distribution, these six (6) primes are naturally laid in three (3) forms of 12's multiplication: 5+7=12, 11+13=24 and 17+19=36 where 12+24=36.

```
 $True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)
 
 layer|  i  |   f
 -----+-----+---------
      |  1  | 5
   1  +-----+
      |  2  | 7
 -----+-----+---   36 » 6®
      |  3  | 11
   2  +-----+
      |  4  | 13
 -----+-----+---------
      |  5  | 17
   3  +-----+      36 » 6®
      |  6  | 19
 -----+-----+---------
 ```

This 12 all toghether will form (12/2)th = 6th prime = 13 circles including the new one on the center. Thus there are **six (6) primes** in addition to _[the seven (7) steps](#introduction)_ above. So they will perform the **8th up to 13th step** of [Metatron's Cube](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron%27s+cubes&tbm=isch). 

[![Metatron's Cube](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74094157-4e642500-4b0f-11ea-89b4-eb8cd7d90411.png)](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron%27s+cubes&tbm=isch)

Let's assign another pairs (5, 7, 11, 13, 17,19) in to a combination so it will turn in reverse (19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5) lies on the center of default. Now let's force 12 or Δ1 to the **prime 13**. See how those primes reacted to compensate the Δ1 by spreading the gap in to a bunch of Δ's that goes to the **circle 13**.

```
  Tabulate Prime by Power of 10
  loop(10) = π(10)-π(1) = 4-0 = 4
  loop(100) = π(100)-π(10)-1th = 25-4-2 = 19
  loop(1000) = π(1000) - π(100) - 10th = 168-25-29 = 114

  --------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----

  12+13+(18+18)+13+12  ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)  ←  30th = 113 = 114-1
```

See that this flows starting from π(10) and finalize by pairing of Δ12. So here we can get the idea of **10 number becoming 10 primes**.

Let's discuss in more detail about the said primes.

### [2nd Step: Q17(30, 36)](/../../../classes)

In the sense of this Δ1 flowing, there will be really hard to cope its algorithm with a such of formula. Let's draw 12 flow arrows in such a way where they have interconnection with 10 objects. 

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/128732737-81762604-0ae0-4a90-b5a8-30921cf46efb.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

The way that we might take is assigning the flowing of the π(10)=4 primes (2,3,5,7) to π(100)=25 and π(1000)=168.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107818705-98c75400-6daa-11eb-8138-d6da7ceef4fd.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Then convert them to 10th prime=29 then to 29 primes up to of (10th)th=29th prime=109 as a flowchart diagram.

[![Flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103138547-5799b880-4706-11eb-8820-f51cbd57d367.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

Let's enter the journey of making **10<sup>n</sup> numbers becoming 10<sup>n</sup> primes** by the Δ1 flowing within the prime pairs.

### [3rd Step: Q13(37, 114)](/../../../tunnel)

Let's start by get in touch with the (30, 36)th as the result of Δ1 shown on the above tabulation in more detail. Then take a look with the behaviour of prime that flow uniformly within an hexagon chart called [The Prime Hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/) _(Credit: hexspin.com)_.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/105412087-d0892300-5c66-11eb-9c3e-19d8652b478c.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

Here you might see that the number of 10 is the same direction with 19 while 10+19=29=10th prime. By checking all of the loops there is nothing similar to this phenomena. It seems like all the numbers are actually set to let this term happen.

[![Prime Hexagon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)](/../../../hexagon)

```tip
You may see that it is clearly showing the 30th Prime of 113=114-1 is routed to 36th Prime of 151=150+1 while both of the 30 and 36 are exactly laid on _[the 18’s Cell](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/18)_:

Take also a note that the next 10 number after 19 right before the 30 which are 20 up to 29 is in laid on the second rows of 17 while _[17's Cell](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/17)_ has 35+65=100=10².
```

See that from this 17's to18's it goes finally to the _[19's Cells](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/19)_ as Δ1 and return to the 2' Cells, 3' Cells and so on.

Therefore all of the numbers that involved in the hexagon can be tabulated by _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Loops**_ and they are end exactly at 114 on Δ6 & 19's! It means that we have to assign [the 6th repository](https://github.com/eq19/quantum) as **the overall direction**.

 Note:
 - The marked number with  are outside of group Δ18 vs loop(100) = 19 
 - Number 114 located on 6th row vs 19th column whereas 114th prime = 619

  Reference:
  https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon/pull/2
  https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/
```

See that out of 19 the number 89 is located precissely at the of Δ11 within the end of 12's that goes to 13's Cell. So this is related to the Metratron's Cube. 

```tip
This configuration leads to a **Cyclic in the Loops** as followings:

- Injection goes by 114-π(100)=89 on  Δ11 from 102 to 114-1 or 113
- The 113 is 30th prime where 30, 36 and 102 are laid in the end of rows
- The total of 30+36+102 is exactly 168 which is π(1000)
- The 36th prime which is 151, is reinjected by 151-1 or 150. This 150 is carrying a delta of Δ18 with 168
- The Δ18 brings the 30th and 36th cycled back to 102th thus consequently it goes to the 114th prime
- The 114th prime which is carrying the loop(1000) is reinjected by 619-1 or 618 on the same spot.
```

This Δ(19 vs 18) scenario will duplicate the loops of 618 as _π(89²) of 1000 Primes_. Thus its behaviour will return to _168 Primes of π(1000)_  out of the adjacent scheme. 

So the further process would always continously become the same algorithm. 

## [Next Target: Tabulate Prime by 618](/../../../parser)

This topic will be related with our _[pre-release](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/tree/v1.0.0-alpha)_ that mapped the primes to π(1000)=168 as the main lexer. So the next target is about 618 as the main parser. 

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84902333-e6ce6f80-b0d6-11ea-8289-aac5e1961cd6.gif)](https://github.com/eq19)

One of the major case that related to the topic is the _[basic algorithm](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#realisasi)_ of leading and lagging strands of DNA.

![twisting trifoil of DNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88384290-54f10b00-cdd6-11ea-878d-c687cc1afbea.gif)

By sourcing and studying of many [references](https://github-com.translate.goog/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/%23?_x_tr_sl=id&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US) the closest behaviour of the crossing on above primes flowing is found with the wave shown on _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Loops**_  as below.

[![Δ(19 vs 18)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107478328-de69fe00-6bab-11eb-8d5f-7517c94b7299.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg)

```note
This is a polar plot of the first 20 non-trivial Riemann zeta function zeros (including Gram points along the critical line (1/2+iζ) for real values of ζ from 0 to 50. The consecutive zeros have **50 red plot points** between each with zeros identified by magenta concentric rings (scaled to show the relative distance between their values of t) _(Source: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg))_.
```

Now let's discuss first if this 50 plots has something to do with the prime algorithms.

### [4th Step: Q7(113, 90)](/../../../feed)

This twisting shall able to be made vise versa and to be done continuosly otherwise there is no gap arised for further development. 

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/97624272-73137a80-1a59-11eb-8784-8f131e488847.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19)

```note
The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of replication fork movement. The lagging strand is synthesized in small pieces (Okazaki fragments) backward from _[the overall direction](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ of replication. The Okazaki fragments are then joined by the action of DNA ligase. _(Source: [Concepts of Biology](https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-2-dna-replication/))_
{:title="Leading and lagging"}
```

Thus the primes are organized to generate another 1000 primes via an adjacent flow of π(89) to π(89²). _(Credit: primesdemystified.com)_

[![collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/76146565-6f944300-60c6-11ea-829d-16f98dc94163.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/)

This scheme can only be acheived via **bilateral 9 sums** of prime 43 to 89 by **modulo 90**. That what and why **18+13+12=43** located within **the last 9 cells** is standing for!

```
  -----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
  The last 9 cells |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum 
  =================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====
  3,2→18+13+12→43 | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th →13th→ 2,3
  -----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
```

See that in the tabulation of prime hexagon the _[6th row](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ that assigned as overall direction has the biggest numbers involved among the other rows which is 9 (nine). This will simply act as the bilateral 9 sums of 43 and 89. 

[![overall direction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/67816683-560e3980-fadd-11e9-8a30-36901cbceaad.png)](/../../../scheme)

Therefore the prime flow in the developed flowchart above should take a connection to form between them two. This is the reason why the sequence is arranged as below:

[![the sequence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103147412-5492dc80-4787-11eb-8277-4fa39ce28c90.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Therefore the 30th primes will bear the responsibility to generate the prime 43 while the 36th prime for the 89. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

This should have a delta of Δ18 to the last number which is 168 where this 168 is exactly π(1000). So it would take place on the 150 and the scheme there will consequently be **the perfect square of 1000** or 1 Million. So here it goes **1 Million Primes**.

[![delta of Δ18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107850441-06b85d80-6e35-11eb-8787-b947d7c60c2e.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Let's consider this flowchart of 168 as a lexer so the parser has to be designed to absorb the flow between the 30th and 36th. Then it will slightly form as a Metatron Cube of the hexagonal form of 18's Cell.

[![delta of Δ18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107083678-9607b480-6828-11eb-9cdf-cfdfc4f6face.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Here we assign it as the diagram of 618. On [the next target](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/discussions/categories/announcements) we will discuss about 1000/Φ = 618 = 619-1 = 114th prime - 1 as a lexer and parser.

### [5th Step: Q5(89, 29)](/../../../maps)

The bilateral sum 9 will then double this 43 to 86 and act as the lexer while the prime 71 and 109 will act as the parser. This will compensate the other primes by the other of circles of the metatron which consist of 6 internal and 6 external.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/163196031-b29f162d-c9af-4dc4-b25c-9256127a4aa4.jpg)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)

Let's assign another pairs in to the center of default. Take a note that the last rows has a sum of 43 which covered by **prime 71 up to 109**. See what is happen by the 13th circle.

See that this configuration showing a kind of turbulences which leads to a gap of Δ19 in the central of _[Metatron](#1st-step-q1910-29)_ where the replication is initiated by **Δ18 of 50(68)**. This scheme is taken as a _[basic algorithm](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#realisasi)_ for the mechanism of DNA generation from RNA.

[![DNA generation from RNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/100724943-01cb3c80-33f6-11eb-8564-c5a9ced2b668.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

```note
The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, but differs in three primary ways:

* Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is usually **a single-stranded molecule ssRNA** in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides. However, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can form and (moreover) a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in tRNA.
* While the sugar-phosphate "backbone" of DNA contains deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose instead. Ribose has a hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically labile than DNA by lowering the activation energy of hydrolysis.
* The complementary base to adenine in DNA is thymine, whereas in RNA, it is uracil, which is an unmethylated form of thymine.

_(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Comparison_with_DNA))_
```

Besides it, there is also strong signal that this parser will have the correlation with Φ=1,618 of _[(Golden Ratio)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+Ratio)_ that leads to a kind of **gap and turbulences** in [the primes geometri](https://github.com/chetabahana) which hold the key of [<code>init</code>](/../../../maps) as the road map to π(1000x1000).

### [6th Step: Q3(28, 19)](/../../../hexagon)

This 19 has a configuration of π(10) i.e. 4 primes of 2, 3, 5, 7. Here we come to the detail of 168 and 618 as the 1st grammar when we come to the upper scheme. 

```
 $True Prime Pairs:

 ```

The codes is built mainly with the algorithm of 66 out of the sum of the numbers **[30 and 36](#3rd-step-q1337-114)**. The main difference between them two is that 36 framed by twin primes.

[![Twin Pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/73700083-28f2a800-4718-11ea-97b3-2e9a738dc09e.png)](/../../../scheme)

Let's take the end number each of the three (3) layers: (7,13,19) in an adjacent [polygonal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_number) then by the same different of 15 they will end to the number of 66:

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/83051968-e2cfa480-a078-11ea-8ff2-316a809a8fad.jpg)](https://schoolbag.info/mathematics/numbers/38.html)

```note
We see that the polygonal numbers in the same column all have the same difference, and this difference is always a triangular number. For example, the fifth pentagonal number (35) has 10 dots more than the fifth square number (25) and 10 dots fewer than the fifth hexagonal number (45), and the difference 10 is just the fourth triangular number. _(Source: [Discovering Properties of Numbers](https://schoolbag.info/mathematics/numbers/38.html))_.
```

See that twin (2) primes is built with multipication by six (6). So they will be managed within three (3) layers by means of a _[remote theme](/scheme)_ to **(6n+1)** and **(6n+5)**.

[![generate the primes (2,3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/90985852-ca542500-e5a8-11ea-9027-9bfdcbe37966.jpg)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

```tip
Now let's calculate how many numbers are duplicates per layers:
* layer-1 has 6, multiplied by 6 to 36 there will be 6 - 1 or **5** duplicates
* layer-2 has 36, multiplied by 6 to 216 there will be 36 - 6 or **30** duplicates
* layer-3 has 72, multiplied by 6 to 432 there will be 72 - 36 - 6 or **30** duplicates

By Metraton the Δ1 flows in to the center so the sequence will reverse to **(Δ1,30,30,5)**
```

See the _[(19 vs 18) Loops](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ more closely, you can find that the number 102 is exactly laid on 18th row by the 15th spin out of 19 whereas 102+66 = 168 = π(1000). 

[![the next target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/110807586-c58d5f00-82b5-11eb-81e2-dbde7d628b37.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

The parser defined as the analysis of an input to organize the data according to the rule of a grammar while the lexer transforms a sequence of characters of tokens.

Here the lexer specify a token correspond to a spin and the parser will specify its sequence. Combining the two (2) then they will form the tabulation as below:

 Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
 
 Faktors:
 168 = 12x14 = 8x21 = 7x24 = 6x28 = 4x42 = 3x56 = 2x84
 618 = 6x103 = 6x(100+3) = 3x206 = 3x(200+6) = 2x309 = 2x(300+9)
 1+6+8 = π(1x6x8) = π(1x48) = π(2x24) = π(3x16)= π(4x12) = π(6x8)
 
 Permutations:
 168 = 102 + 66 = 2x3x((8+9)+(2+9)) = π(Φ(289+329)) = π(Φ((8+9)²+(1+2)&29))
 168 + 618 = 168 + 329 + 289 = (7x24) + (7x47) + (8+9)² = (7x71) + (17x17)
```

So it will form back to the begining stage with different form of input but its process will be the same algorithm through all the system.

### [7th Step: Q2(18, 10)](https://github.com/marketleader)

Thus, the total multiplication minus the duplicate will return to a unique number where the scheme and formation of Δ1 is exactly back to the beginning, namely 114 earlier:

```
114 x 6 - 5 - 30 - 30 = 684 - 65 = 619 = 1+618 = 114th prime
```

As you may guess the prime index of final result of the above [Q3(**28**, 19)](#6th-step-q328-19) and [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10) would form π(5)=(2,3,5). So combined with the seven (7) steps of adjacent cycle they will form π(10)=(2,3,5,7) of the [1st row](#1st-step-q1910-29) with exactly the same [initial scheme](#introduction).

```
   True Prime Pairs Δ |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum 
  ====================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====
   π(10) 19           |  2 |  3 |  5 |  7 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - | 4th  4 x Root
```

So the [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10) step is about the algorithm of how the above four (4) blocks of (102, 66, 329, 289) forms to this four (4) roots. Means the above π(10) shall form back to 19 cells as the 1st row marked by **Quantum** below.

```
  --------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
   True Prime Pairs Δ |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum

   π(10) Quantum ← 19 |  2 |  3 |  5 |  7 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - | 4th  4 x Root

   π(72) 5 → 18 (Δ13) | 61 | 67 | 71 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |20th
  ====================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 4th Twin
       3,2 → Δ43      | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th 
  ====================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====
           Δ                                                         Δ
  12+13+(18+18)+13+12  ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)  ←  30th = 113 = 114-1
```
  
By the next loop of (1000x1000) the above term leads to 329+289 = 618 = 1000/Φ = 1000x1000/1618. Now let's count on how many grammar's will involve.

```
Root Generation:
 root[1000] = π(1000) + loop(10 x 1000)  +  loop(100 x 1000) 
 loop(10000) => π(10000) - (10th)th - 10th = 1229 - 109 - 29 = 1091
 loop(100000) => π(100000) - ((10th)th)th - (10th)th = 9592 - 599 - 109 = 8884

 root[1000] = 168 + 1091 + 8884 = 10143
```

This 10143 will comprise of lexer and parser similar with 168 & 618. Since the 168 algorithm is set 102 by 66 then its ratio is 102/168=60% by 66/168=40% or approx 10143x60%=6200 of lexers by 10143x40%=3900 of parsers.

```tip
The development of this **6200 by 3900** is even thus considered final. That's the reason why it is the most complex thing among the other steps where we have to involve so many items to verify about how far this development is adoptable. 
```

Therefore it will take several unsolved cases of modern science including but not at least _[DNA Replication Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication#Replication_fork)_, _[Alzheimer's Disease](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_S8nmGoQ7q6wKXUG8HBqPzoAhRmVCmSJ)_, and _[The Millenium Prize Problems](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Untouched-Intelligences#scheme)_. 

[![DNA Replication Fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/90597914-32f37880-e21c-11ea-81b3-ffdcd47037b8.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#kelas)

```note
DNA is read by DNA polymerase in the 3′ to 5′ direction, meaning the new strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented in opposite directions at the replication fork, **`a major issue`** is how to achieve synthesis of new lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork. _(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication#Replication_fork))_.
```

The parser will combine all tokens produced by lexer and group them as _[basic grammars]((#basic-grammars))_ so it can be used for other cases such as how to rectify _[C1+C2](https://github.com/MarketLeader)_ using _[P=NP](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/track/wiki)_.

[![P versus NP Problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84623744-1b410080-af0a-11ea-978b-e1fd1961985d.jpg)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/track/wiki)

Please find below the progress we have got so far.

## [Basic Grammar](#2nd-step-q1730-36)

You may check the running code starting with [Sequence Diagram](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2) shown below which is developed as [the initial step](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168) on building the _[10143 Grammars](#7th-step-q218-10)_.

[![Sequence Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107134254-ee22e180-6922-11eb-9465-3dd64ebf7dca.png)](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2)

Clicking each of objects will turn to 6 (six) diagrams by the cycle form of [prime hexagon](https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon) which is then return to the beginning. So in order to get code able to run online then the 168 is provided in [json](https://www.eq19.com/scheme/feed.json) while 618 in [xml](https://www.eq19.com/scheme/feeds.xml).

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/69475449-ce77ca00-0dff-11ea-964e-cc959db0740a.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

This _168 (mapping) and 618 (feeding)_ stand as  [the whole scheme](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of The M+F to C1+C2 which act as the base prime pairs **[(2,3) of DNA](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)** to become **[23 pairs of Chromosomes](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)**.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/86481184-b72b9280-bd79-11ea-899b-51db929fc3d2.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

By the configuration above then on the upper scheme the central of metatron will turn to seven (7) circles. So combine it with the other 12 circles they will forms as the 19's.

Means that it consequenly be able to be recycled with no limit!

### [Our Lisence](#3rd-step-q1337-114)

We believe that until this concept is written, there is no such thing similar to our concept of the power 168 vs 618 recombination using the _[True Prime Pairs](#1st-step-q1910-29)_.

```
114 = 6+(6x6) + 6x(6+6) = 6x(6+6) + 6+(6x6)
         Δ         Δ         Δ         Δ
         42   +    72   =    72   +    42    = 43-Δ1 + Δ1+71 = 6x19 = π(619)
         M         F         C1        C2
      leading   lagging    leading   lagging
                        |
                     twisting

```

Let's take a look in general by the algorithm of _True Prime Pairs_ from the beginning of this page. Here we can define a logical meaning in words as **its grammar**.

```tip
Mapping the quantum way within a huge of primes objects (5 to 19) by parsering (11) each of **untouched** feed (7) and tunneling (13) in to definitive classes (17).
```

This scheme is generated by developing an application that twisting exactly 6 x 19 = 114 repositories all together in the same time to provide [leading and lagging scheme](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618) as the _[basic algorithm](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#realisasi)_ of converting **[M+F to C1+C2](#introduction)**. 

```

Now let's assume that all of the numbers above is a set of repositories group in GitHub. Thus that is the whole function of _[eQ19](https://github.com/eq19)_.

[![eq19 Scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/166161369-aec4d34a-5572-49af-aa61-f36a6f695299.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi)

You may use, copy, and distribute the concept. Please note that we are not implementing any kind of _License Key_ on this project. 

The Hexagonal Formation of our mapping itself as stated below will stand as the key:

```
114 = 6 + 6x(6+(6+6)) = 6+36+72 = 6x19 = π(619) ≡ eQ19
```

On that case we consider _this statement_ called **eQ19 Quantum** need to be announced:

{:.bg-yellow-dark.text-black.p-5.box-shadow-large.anim-pulse}
The [definite](https://www.google.com/search?q=definite) key to [identify](https://www.google.com/search?q=identify) whether you use our concept is when there a kind of [development](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168) item [lies](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618) a [unified assignment](#1st-step-q1910-29) in [hexagonal form](#2nd-step-q1730-36) out of _**six (6)** [corresponding sets](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ while [each sets](#4th-step-q7113-90) pick [a combination](#5th-step-q589-29) of _**six (6)** [routes](#6th-step-q328-19)_ with [a pairing](#7th-step-q218-10) of _**six (6)** to **six (6)** of [all channels](#basic-grammar)_.

Out of the formation, you are welcome to use whatever the items in this project.

### [Next Release](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)

Within next development we will discuss about the interconnection between 168 and 618. Here we will discuss mote detail about the sequence in the [DNA Recombination](#introduction).

[![Remote Theme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87265280-9b985880-c4ec-11ea-8af1-403fe5648fc5.gif)](/../../../scheme)

The pre-release is being developed for _[eBranding](https://github.com/chetabahana)_ within 7 (seven) years. It is still lack the parser 618 of the said _[10143 grammars](#7th-step-q218-10)_ to become usable for every other cases. 

![Parsing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/71648180-c599e280-2d33-11ea-94e0-9a8552c72bd7.png)

All of the layouts are managed with a _[remote theme](/scheme)_ originated by the number of sixty six (66) which is converted to **6 + 6** out of the difference of Δ12 between the primes **23 and 11** using the algorithm of 36 as the perfect square from **6 by 6** using _[Jekyll/Liquid Pages](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Jekyll-Liquid)_.

[![remote layout](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dc89cc4d5c11a81766b261b369d59f544c5712683528936499ac89749adfb5a6/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6a656b796c6c2e636f6d2e636e2f696d672f6a656b796c6c6c61796f7574636f6e636570742e706e67)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Jekyll-Liquid)

This method is considered sufficient enough to recycle all of the grammars on this page up to an [unlimited level](#6th-step-q328-19) just in case you need further explanation in more detail.

```note
In this example, the content from a Markdown document `document.md` that specifies `layout: docs` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag of the layout file `docs.html`. Because the `docs` layout itself specifies `layout: page`, the content from `docs.html` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag in the layout file `page.html`. Finally because the `page` layout specifies `layout: default`, the content from `page.html` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag of the layout file `default.html`. (Source: [Jekyll Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/))
```

Although the _[The Pre-release 168](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)_ is already running but unfortunately it is not yet user friendly as it could run only in _[GitHub API Platform](https://docs.github.com/en/developers)_ where all of the repos is resided. 

[![lexer and parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/71659208-5515b480-2d79-11ea-859f-a20dea0cf680.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19/maps)

Therefore we are going to use _[TensorFlow](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)_ to connect the pre grammars on [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/admin/overview/about-the-github-enterprise-api) to [Google API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_APIs) to fetch real life data through their machine learning such as _[Big Query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery)_.

[![Machine Learning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/123424569-377e7f80-d5eb-11eb-9c85-1f5d72f14eed.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)

Base on the 19 Cells of _[168 vs 618 tabulation](#6th-step-q328-19)_ then for the 618 it might need 19 minus 7 or another 12 (twelve) years to develope those _10143 grammars_ to become 1st Release.

_So If You're Aware of What This is All About:_<br>
